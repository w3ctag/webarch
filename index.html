        The <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> (<dfn><abbr>WWW</abbr></dfn>, or simply

            While planning a trip to Mexico, Nadia reads “Oaxaca weather

            that she is likely to be able to retrieve associated information

            accordance with its configured behavior for resources identified
            via the "http" URI scheme.
            </li>
            <li>The authority responsible for "weather.example.com" provides

            <li>The browser interprets the response, identified as XHTML by the
            server, and performs additional retrieval actions for inline
            graphics and other content as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>The browser displays the retrieved information, which includes
            hypertext links to other information. Nadia can follow these
            hypertext links to retrieve additional information.

      <p>
        This scenario illustrates the three architectural bases of the Web that
        are discussed in this document:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a>Identification</a>. URIs are used to identify resources. In this
            travel scenario, the resource is a periodically updated report on
            the weather in Oaxaca, and the URI is
            “http://weather.example.com/oaxaca”.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a>Interaction</a>. Web agents communicate using standardized
            protocols that enable interaction through the exchange of messages
            which adhere to a defined syntax and semantics. By entering a URI
            into a retrieval dialog or selecting a hypertext link, Nadia tells
            her browser to perform a retrieval action for the resource
            identified by the URI. In this example, the browser sends an HTTP
            GET request (part of the HTTP protocol) to the server at
            "weather.example.com", via TCP/IP port 80, and the server sends
            back a message containing what it determines to be a representation
            of the resource as of the time that representation was generated.
            Note that this example is specific to hypertext browsing of
            information—other kinds of interaction are possible, both within
            browsers and through the use of other types of Web agent; our
            example is intended to illustrate one common interaction, not
            define the range of possible interactions or limit the ways in
            which agents might use the Web.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a>Formats</a>. Most protocols used for representation retrieval
            and/or submission make use of a sequence of one or more messages,
            which taken together contain a payload of representation data and
            metadata, to transfer the representation between agents. The choice
            of interaction protocol places limits on the formats of
            representation data and metadata that can be transmitted. HTTP, for
            example, typically transmits a single octet stream plus metadata,
            and uses the "Content-Type" and "Content-Encoding" header fields to
            further identify the format of the representation. In this
            scenario, the representation transferred is in XHTML, as identified
            by the "Content-type" HTTP header field containing the registered
            Internet media type name, "application/xhtml+xml". That Internet
            media type name indicates that the representation data can be
            processed according to the XHTML specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nadia's browser is configured and programmed to interpret the
            receipt of an "application/xhtml+xml" typed representation as an
            instruction to render the content of that representation according
            to the XHTML rendering model, including any subsidiary interactions
            (such as requests for external style sheets or in-line images)
            called for by the representation. In the scenario, the XHTML
            representation data received from the initial request instructs
            Nadia's browser to also retrieve and render in-line the weather
            maps, each identified by a URI and thus causing an additional
            retrieval action, resulting in additional representations that are
            processed by the browser according to their own data formats (e.g.,
            "application/svg+xml" indicates the SVG data format), and this
            process continues until all of the data formats have been rendered.
            The result of all of this processing, once the browser has reached
            an application steady-state that completes Nadia's initial
            requested action, is commonly referred to as a "Web page".

            Many of the examples in this document that involve human activity
            suppose the familiar Web interaction model (illustrated at the
            beginning of the Introduction) where a person follows a link via a
            user agent, the user agent retrieves and presents data, the user
            follows another link, etc. This document does not discuss in any
            detail other interaction models such as voice browsing (see, for
            example, [[!VOICEXML20]]). The choice of interaction model may have
            an impact on expected agent behavior. For instance, when a
            graphical user agent running on a laptop computer or hand-held
            device encounters an error, the user agent can report errors
            directly to the user through visual and audio cues, and present the
            user with options for resolving the errors. On the other hand, when
            someone is browsing the Web through voice input and audio-only
            output, stopping the dialog to wait for user input may reduce
            usability since it is so easy to "lose one's place" when browsing
            with only audio-output. This document does not discuss how the
            principles, constraints, and good practices identified here apply
            in all interaction contexts.

              An architectural principle is a fundamental rule that applies to
              a large number of situations and variables. Architectural
              principles include "separation of concerns", "generic interface",
              "self-descriptive syntax," "visible semantics," "network effect"
              (Metcalfe's Law), and Amdahl's Law: "The speed of a system is
              limited by its slowest component."

            <dd>
              In the design of the Web, some choices, like the names of the
              <code>p</code> and <code>li</code> elements in HTML, the choice
              of the colon (:) character in URIs, or grouping bits into
              eight-bit units (octets), are somewhat arbitrary; if
              <code>paragraph</code> had been chosen instead of <code>p</code>
              or asterisk (*) instead of colon, the large-scale result would,
              most likely, have been the same. This document focuses on more
              fundamental design choices: design choices that lead to
              constraints, i.e., restrictions in behavior or interaction within
              the system. Constraints may be imposed for technical, policy, or
              other reasons to achieve desirable properties in the system, such
              as accessibility, global scope, relative ease of evolution,
              efficiency, and dynamic extensibility.

            <dd>
              Good practice—by software developers, content authors, site

        Identification
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to communicate internally, a community agrees (to a reasonable
        extent) on a set of terms and their meanings. One goal of the Web,
        since its inception, has been to build a global community in which any
        party can share information with any other party. To achieve this goal,
        the Web makes use of a single global identification system: the URI.
        URIs are a cornerstone of Web architecture, providing identification
        that is common across the Web. The global scope of URIs promotes
        large-scale "network effects": the value of an identifier increases the
        more it is used consistently (for example, the more it is used in
        <a>hypertext links</a>).

        <p>
          The choice of syntax for global identifiers is somewhat arbitrary; it
          is their global scope that is important. The <dfn>Uniform Resource
          Identifier</dfn>, [[!URI]], has been successfully deployed since the
          creation of the Web. There are substantial benefits to participating
          in the existing network of URIs, including linking, bookmarking,
          caching, and indexing by search engines, and there are substantial
          costs to creating a new identification system that has the same
          properties as URIs.

          A resource should have an associated URI if another party might

          include all or part of it by reference into another representation,
          annotate it, or perform other operations on it. Software developers
          should expect that sharing URIs across applications will be useful,
          even if that utility is not initially evident. The TAG finding

          URI/Resource Relationships
        </h3>
        <p>
          By design a URI identifies one resource. We do not limit the scope of
          what might be a <dfn>resource</dfn>. The term "resource" is used in a
          general sense for whatever might be identified by a URI. It is
          conventional on the hypertext Web to describe Web pages, images,
          product catalogs, etc. as “resources”. The distinguishing
          characteristic of these resources is that all of their essential
          characteristics can be conveyed in a message. We identify this set as
          “<dfn>information resources</dfn>.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This document is an example of an information resource. It consists
          of words and punctuation symbols and graphics and other artifacts
          that can be encoded, with varying degrees of fidelity, into a
          sequence of bits. There is nothing about the essential information
          content of this document that cannot in principle be transfered in a
          message. In the case of this document, the message payload is the
          <a>representation</a> of this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, our use of the term resource is intentionally more broad.
          Other things, such as cars and dogs (and, if you've printed this
          document on physical sheets of paper, the artifact that you are
          holding in your hand), are resources too. They are not information
          resources, however, because their essence is not information.
          Although it is possible to describe a great many things about a car
          or a dog in a sequence of bits, the sum of those things will
          invariably be an approximation of the essential character of the
          resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define the term “information resource” because we observe that it
          is useful in discussions of Web technology and may be useful in
          constructing specifications for facilities built for use on the Web.

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Since the scope of a URI is global, the resource identified by a URI
          does not depend on the context in which the URI appears (see also the
          section about <a class="section">indirect identification</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          [[!URI]] is an agreement about how the Internet community allocates
          names and associates them with the resources they identify. URIs are
          divided into <a>schemes</a> that define, via their scheme
          specification, the mechanism by which scheme-specific identifiers are
          associated with resources. For example, the "http" URI scheme
          ([[!HTTP11]]) uses DNS and TCP-based HTTP servers for the purpose of
          identifier allocation and resolution. As a result, identifiers such
          as "http://example.com/somepath#someFrag" often take on meaning
          through the community experience of performing an HTTP GET request on
          the identifier and, if given a successful response, interpreting the
          response as a representation of the identified resource. (See also
          <a>Fragment Identifiers</a>.) Of course, a retrieval action like GET
          is not the only way to obtain information about a resource. One might
          also publish a document that purports to define the meaning of a
          particular URI. These other sources of information may suggest
          meanings for such identifiers, but it's a local policy decision
          whether those suggestions should be heeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as one might wish to refer to a person by different names (by
          full name, first name only, sports nickname, romantic nickname, and
          so forth), Web architecture allows the association of more than one
          URI with a resource. URIs that identify the same resource are called
          <dfn>URI aliases</dfn>. The section on <a>URI aliases</a> discusses
          some of the potential costs of creating multiple URIs for the same
          resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several sections of this document address questions about the
          relationship between URIs and resources, including:
        </p>

            By design, a URI identifies one resource. Using the same URI to
            directly identify different resources produces a <dfn>URI
            collision</dfn>. Collision often imposes a cost in communication
            due to the effort required to resolve ambiguities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose, for example, that one organization makes use of a URI to
            refer to the movie <cite>The Sting</cite>, and another organization
            uses the same URI to refer to a discussion forum about <cite>The
            Sting</cite>. To a third party, aware of both organizations, this
            collision creates confusion about what the URI identifies,
            undermining the value of the URI. If one wanted to talk about the
            creation date of the resource identified by the URI, for instance,
            it would not be clear whether this meant "when the movie was
            created" or "when the discussion forum about the movie was
            created."

            Social and technical solutions have been devised to help avoid URI
            collision. However, the success or failure of these different
            approaches depends on the extent to which there is consensus in the
            Internet community on abiding by the defining specifications.

          <p>
            URI allocation is the process of associating a URI with a resource.
            Allocation can be performed both by resource owners and by other
            parties. It is important to avoid <a>URI collision</a>.

              URI ownership
            </h5>
            <p>
              <dfn>URI ownership</dfn> is a relation between a URI and a social
              entity, such as a person, organization, or specification. URI
              ownership gives the relevant social entity certain rights,
              including:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>to pass on ownership of some or all owned URIs to another
              owner—delegation; and
              </li>
              <li>to associate a resource with an owned URI—URI allocation.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              By social convention, URI ownership is delegated from the IANA
              URI scheme registry [[!IANASchemes]], itself a social entity, to
              IANA-registered URI scheme specifications. Some URI scheme
              specifications further delegate ownership to subordinate
              registries or to other nominated owners, who may further delegate
              ownership. In the case of a specification, ownership ultimately
              lies with the community that maintains the specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              The approach taken for the "http" URI scheme, for example,
              follows the pattern whereby the Internet community delegates
              authority, via the IANA URI scheme registry and the DNS, over a
              set of URIs with a common prefix to one particular owner. One
              consequence of this approach is the Web's heavy reliance on the
              central DNS registry. A different approach is taken by the URN
              Syntax scheme [[!RFC2141] which delegates ownership of portions
              of URN space to URN Namespace specifications which themselves are
              registered in an IANA-maintained registry of URN Namespace
              Identifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
              URI owners are responsible for avoiding the assignment of
              equivalent URIs to multiple resources. Thus, if a URI scheme
              specification does provide for the delegation of individual or
              organized sets of URIs, it should take pains to ensure that
              ownership ultimately resides in the hands of a single social
              entity. Allowing multiple owners increases the likelihood of URI
              collisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              URI owners may organize or deploy infrastruture to ensure that
              representations of associated resources are available and, where
              appropriate, interaction with the resource is possible through
              the exchange of representations. There are social expectations
              for responsible <a class="addrefnb">representation management</a>
              by URI owners. Additional social implications of URI ownership
              are not discussed here.

              Some schemes use techniques other than delegated ownership to
              avoid collision. For example, the specification for the data URL
              (sic) scheme [[!RFC2397]] specifies that the resource identified
              by a data scheme URI has only one possible representation. The
              representation data makes up the URI that identifies that
              resource. Thus, the specification itself determines how data URIs
              are allocated; no delegation is possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other schemes (such as "news:comp.text.xml") rely on a social
              process.

            that begins, "Today, 10 Downing Street announced a series of new
            economic measures." Generally, "10 Downing Street" identifies the
            official residence of Britain's Prime Minister. In this context,
            the news reporter is using it (as English rhetoric allows) to
            indirectly identify the British government. Similarly, URIs
            identify resources, but they can also be used in many constructs to
            indirectly identify other resources. Globally adopted assignment
            policies make some URIs appealing as general-purpose identifiers.
            Local policy establishes what they indirectly identify.

            using the URI as a database key in their database of conference
            participants). This does not introduce a URI collision.

          URIs that are identical, character-by-character, refer to the same
          resource. Since Web Architecture allows the association of multiple

          resource. Different URIs do not necessarily refer to different

          <p>
            Although there are benefits (such as naming flexibility) to URI
            aliases, there are also costs. URI aliases are harmful when they
            divide the Web of related resources. A corollary of Metcalfe's
            Principle (the "network effect") is that the value of a given
            resource can be measured by the number and value of other resources
            in its network neighborhood, that is, the resources that link to
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with aliases is that if half of the neighborhood points
            to one URI for a given resource, and the other half points to a
            second, different URI for that same resource, the neighborhood is
            divided. Not only is the aliased resource undervalued because of
            this split, the entire neighborhood of resources loses value
            because of the missing second-order relationships that should have
            existed among the referring resources by virtue of their references
            to the aliased resource.

            URI consumers also have a role in ensuring URI consistency. For
            instance, when transcribing a URI, agents should not gratuitously
            percent-encode characters. The term "character" refers to URI
            characters as defined in section 2 of [[!URI]]; percent-encoding is
            discussed in section 2.1 of that specification.

                and labels his link “report on weather in Oaxaca on
                1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2004”. Nadia points out to Dirk that he is
                setting misleading expectations for the URI he has used. The
                Oaxaca weather site policy is that the URI in question
                identifies a report on the current weather in Oaxaca—on any
                given day—and not the weather on 1 August. Of course, on the
                first of August in 2004, Dirk's link will be correct, but the
                rest of the time he will be misleading readers. Nadia points
                out to Dirk that the managers of the Oaxaca weather site do
                make available a different URI permanently assigned to a

            assign two URIs to these two different resources. On
            1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2004, the representations for these resources
            are identical. That fact that dereferencing two different URIs

            are aliases.

        <p>
          In the URI "http://weather.example.com/", the "http" that appears
          before the colon (":") names a URI scheme. Each URI scheme has a
          specification that explains the scheme-specific details of how scheme
          identifiers are allocated and become associated with a resource. The
          URI syntax is thus a federated and extensible naming system wherein
          each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and
          semantics of identifiers within that scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of URIs from various schemes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>mailto:joe@example.org
          </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          While Web architecture allows the definition of new schemes,
          introducing a new scheme is costly. Many aspects of URI processing
          are scheme-dependent, and a large amount of deployed software already
          processes URIs of well-known schemes. Introducing a new URI scheme
          requires the development and deployment not only of client software
          to handle the scheme, but also of ancillary agents such as gateways,
          proxies, and caches. See [[!RFC2718]] for other considerations and
          costs related to URI scheme design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of these costs, if a URI scheme exists that meets the needs
          of an application, designers should use it rather than invent one.

            Unregistered URI schemes SHOULD NOT be used for a number of
            reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>There is no generally accepted way to locate the scheme
            specification.
            </li>
            <li>Someone else may be using the scheme for other purposes.
            </li>
            <li>One should not expect that general-purpose software will do
            anything useful with URIs of this scheme beyond URI comparison.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One misguided motivation for registering a new URI scheme is to
            allow a software agent to launch a particular application when
            retrieving a representation. The same thing can be accomplished at
            lower expense by dispatching instead on the type of the
            representation, thereby allowing use of existing transfer protocols
            and implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if an agent cannot process representation data in an unknown
            format, it can at least retrieve it. The data may contain enough
            information to allow a user or user agent to make some use of it.
            When an agent does not handle a new URI scheme, it cannot retrieve
            a representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            When designing a new data format, the preferred mechanism to
            promote its deployment on the Web is the Internet media type (see
            <a href="#internet-media-type">Representation Types and Internet
            Media Types</a>). Media types also provide a means for building new
            information applications, as described in <a href=

          URI Opacity
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is tempting to guess the nature of a resource by inspection of a
          URI that identifies it. However, the Web is designed so that agents
          communicate resource information state through <a href=
          "#def-representation">representations</a>, not identifiers. In
          general, one cannot determine the type of a resource representation
          by inspecting a URI for that resource. For example, the ".html" at
          the end of "http://example.com/page.html" provides no guarantee that
          representations of the identified resource will be served with the
          Internet media type "text/html". The publisher is free to allocate
          identifiers and define how they are served. The HTTP protocol does
          not constrain the Internet media type based on the path component of
          the URI; the URI owner is free to configure the server to return a
          representation using PNG or any other data format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resource state may evolve over time. Requiring a URI owner to publish
          a new URI for each change in resource state would lead to a
          significant number of broken references. For robustness, Web
          architecture promotes independence between an identifier and the
          state of the identified resource.

          The example URI used in the <a href="#scenario">travel scenario</a>
          ("http://weather.example.com/oaxaca") suggests to a human reader that
          the identified resource has something to do with the weather in
          Oaxaca. A site reporting the weather in Oaxaca could just as easily
          be identified by the URI "http://vjc.example.com/315". And the URI
          "http://weather.example.com/vancouver" might identify the resource
          "my photo album."
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the URI "mailto:joe@example.com" indicates that
          the URI refers to a mailbox. The "mailto" URI scheme specification
          authorizes agents to infer that URIs of this form identify Internet
          mailboxes.

          The <dfn>fragment identifier</dfn> component of a URI allows indirect
          identification of a <dfn>secondary resource</dfn> by reference to a
          primary resource and additional identifying information. The
          secondary resource may be some portion or subset of the primary
          resource, some view on representations of the primary resource, or
          some other resource defined or described by those representations.
          The terms "primary resource" and "secondary resource" are defined in
          section 3.5 of [[!URI]].
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms “primary” and “secondary” in this context do not limit the
          nature of the resource—they are not classes. In this context, primary
          and secondary simply indicate that there is a relationship between
          the resources for the purposes of one URI: the URI with a fragment
          identifier. Any resource can be identified as a secondary resource.
          It might also be identified using a URI without a fragment
          identifier, and a resource may be identified as a secondary resource
          via multiple URIs. The purpose of these terms is to enable discussion
          of the relationship between such resources, not to limit the nature
          of a resource.

        <dfn>message</dfn> may include data as well as metadata about a
        resource (such as the "Alternates" and "Vary" HTTP headers), the
        message data, and the message itself (such as the "Transfer-encoding"
        HTTP header). A message may even include metadata about the message

            Nadia follows a hypertext link labeled "satellite image" expecting

            by contacting an intermediary (such as a proxy server), or by
            direct access to the server identified by a portion of the URI. In
            this example, the browser opens a network connection to port 80 on

          Using a URI to Access a Resource
        </h3>
        <p>
          Agents may use a URI to access the referenced resource; this is
          called <dfn>dereferencing the URI</dfn>. Access may take many forms,
          including retrieving a representation of the resource (for instance,
          by using HTTP GET or HEAD), adding or modifying a representation of
          the resource (for instance, by using HTTP POST or PUT, which in some
          cases may change the actual state of the resource if the submitted
          representations are interpreted as instructions to that end), and
          deleting some or all representations of the resource (for instance,
          by using HTTP DELETE, which in some cases may result in the deletion
          of the resource itself).
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be more than one way to access a resource for a given URI;
          application context determines which access method an agent uses. For
          instance, a browser might use HTTP GET to retrieve a representation
          of a resource, whereas a hypertext link checker might use HTTP HEAD
          on the same URI simply to establish whether a representation is
          available. Some URI schemes set expectations about available access
          methods, others (such as the URN scheme [[!URN]]) do not. Section
          1.2.2 of [[!URI]] discusses the separation of identification and
          interaction in more detail. For more information about relationships
          between multiple access methods and URI addressability, see the TAG
          finding <cite>"<a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html">URIs,
          Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST</a>"</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although many <a href="#URI-scheme">URI schemes</a> are named after
          protocols, this does not imply that use of such a URI will
          necessarily result in access to the resource via the named protocol.
          Even when an agent uses a URI to retrieve a representation, that
          access might be through gateways, proxies, caches, and name
          resolution services that are independent of the protocol associated
          with the scheme name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many URI schemes define a default interaction protocol for attempting
          access to the identified resource. That interaction protocol is often
          the basis for allocating identifiers within that scheme, just as
          "http" URIs are defined in terms of TCP-based HTTP servers. However,
          this does not imply that all interaction with such resources is
          limited to the default interaction protocol. For example, information
          retrieval systems often make use of proxies to interact with a
          multitude of URI schemes, such as HTTP proxies being used to access
          "ftp" and "wais" resources. Proxies can also to provide enhanced
          services, such as annotation proxies that combine normal information
          retrieval with additional metadata retrieval to provide a seamless,
          multidimensional view of resources using the same protocols and user
          agents as the non-annotated Web. Likewise, future protocols may be
          defined that encompass our current systems, using entirely different
          interaction mechanisms, without changing the existing identifier
          schemes. See also, <a href="#orthogonal-specs">principle of
          orthogonal specifications</a>.

          <p>
            Dereferencing a URI generally involves a succession of steps as
            described in multiple specifications and implemented by the agent.
            The following example illustrates the series of specifications that
            governs the process when a user agent is instructed to follow a
            <a href="#hypertext">hypertext link</a> that is part of an SVG
            document. In this example, the URI is
            "http://weather.example.com/oaxaca" and the application context
            calls for the user agent to retrieve and render a representation of
            the identified resource.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Since the URI is part of a hypertext link in an SVG document,
            the first relevant specification is the SVG 1.1 Recommendation
            [<a href="#SVG11">SVG11</a>]. <a href=
            "/TR/SVG11/linking.html#Links">Section 17.1</a> of this
            specification imports the link semantics defined in XLink 1.0
            [<a href="#XLink10">XLink10</a>]: "The remote resource (the
            destination for the link) is defined by a URI specified by the
            XLink <code>href</code> attribute on the '<code>a</code>' element."
            The SVG specification goes on to state that interpretation of an
            <code>a</code> element involves retrieving a representation of a
            resource, identified by the <code>href</code> attribute in the
            XLink namespace: "By activating these links (by clicking with the
            mouse, through keyboard input, voice commands, etc.), users may
            visit these resources."
            </li>
            <li>The XLink 1.0 [<a href="#XLink10">XLink10</a>] specification,
            which defines the <code>href</code> attribute in section 5.4,
            states that "The value of the href attribute must be a URI
            reference as defined in [IETF RFC 2396], or must result in a URI
            reference after the escaping procedure described below is applied."
            </li>
            <li>The URI specification [[!URI]] states that "Each URI begins
            with a scheme name that refers to a specification for assigning
            identifiers within that scheme." The URI scheme name in this
            example is "http".
            </li>
            <li>[[!IANASchemes]] states that the "http" scheme is defined by
            the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616 [[!HTTP11]], section 3.2.2).
            </li>
            <li>In this SVG context, the agent constructs an HTTP GET request
            (per section 9.3 of [[!HTTP11]]) to retrieve the representation.
            </li>
            <li>Section 6 of [[!HTTP11]] defines how the server constructs a
            corresponding response message, including the 'Content-Type' field.
            </li>
            <li>Section 1.4 of [[!HTTP11]] states "HTTP communication usually
            takes place over TCP/IP connections." This example addresses
            neither that step in the process nor other steps such as Domain
            Name System (<abbr>DNS</abbr>) resolution.
            </li>
            <li>The agent interprets the returned representation according to
            the data format specification that corresponds to the
            representation's <a href="#internet-media-type">Internet Media
            Type</a> (the value of the HTTP 'Content-Type') in the relevant

            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Precisely which representation(s) are retrieved depends on a number
            of factors, including:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Whether the URI owner makes available any representations at
            all;
            </li>
            <li>Whether the agent making the request has access privileges for
            those representations (see the section on <a href=
            "#id-access">linking and access control</a>);
            </li>
            <li>If the URI owner has provided more than one representation (in
            different formats such as HTML, PNG, or RDF; in different languages
            such as English and Spanish; or transformed dynamically according
            to the hardware or software capabilities of the recipient), the
            resulting representation may depend on negotiation between the user
            agent and server.
            </li>
            <li>The time of the request; the world changes over time, so
            representations of resources are also likely to change over time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Assuming that a representation has been successfully retrieved, the
            expressive power of the representation's format will affect how
            precisely the representation provider communicates resource state.
            If the representation communicates the state of the resource
            inaccurately, this inaccuracy or ambiguity may lead to confusion
            among users about what the resource is. If different users reach
            different conclusions about what the resource is, they may
            interpret this as a <a href="#URI-collision">URI collision</a> .
            Some communities, such as the ones developing the Semantic Web,
            seek to provide a framework for accurately communicating the
            semantics of a resource in a machine readable way. Machine readable
            semantics may alleviate some of the ambiguity associated with
            natural language descriptions of resources.

        </h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>representation</dfn> is data that encodes information about
          resource state. Representations do not necessarily describe the
          resource, or portray a likeness of the resource, or represent the
          resource in other senses of the word "represent".
        </p>
        <p>
          Representations of a resource may be sent or received using
          interaction protocols. These protocols in turn determine the form in
          which representations are conveyed on the Web. HTTP, for example,
          provides for transmission of representations as octet streams typed
          using Internet media types [<a href="#RFC2046">RFC2046</a>].
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as it is important to reuse existing URI schemes whenever
          possible, there are significant benefits to using media typed octet
          streams for representations even in the unusual case where a new URI
          scheme and associated protocol is to be defined. For example, if the
          Oaxaca weather were conveyed to Nadia's browser using a protocol
          other than HTTP, then software to render formats such as
          text/xhmtl+xml and image/png would still be usable if the new
          protocol supported transmission of those types. This is an example of
          the <a href="#orthogonal-specs">principle of orthogonal
          specifications</a>.

                In one of his XHTML pages, Dirk creates a hypertext link to an
                image that Nadia has published on the Web. He creates a
                hypertext link with <code>&lt;a
                href="http://www.example.com/images/nadia#hat"&gt;Nadia's
                hat&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Emma views Dirk's XHTML page in her Web
                browser and follows the link. The HTML implementation in her
                browser removes the fragment from the URI and requests the
                image "http://www.example.com/images/nadia". Nadia serves an
                SVG representation of the image (with Internet media type
                "image/svg+xml"). Emma's Web browser starts up an SVG
                implementation to view the image. It passes it the original URI
                including the fragment,
                "http://www.example.com/images/nadia#hat" to this
                implementation, causing a view of the hat to be displayed
                rather than the complete image.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Note that the HTML implementation in Emma's browser did not need to
            <em>understand the syntax or semantics</em> of the SVG fragment
            (nor does the SVG implementation have to understand HTML, WebCGM,
            RDF ... fragment syntax or semantics; it merely had to recognize
            the # delimiter from the URI syntax [URI] and remove the fragment
            when accessing the resource). This <a href=
            "#orthogonal-specs">orthogonality</a> is an important feature of
            Web architecture; it is what enabled Emma's browser to provide a
            useful service without requiring an upgrade.
          </p>
          <p>
            The semantics of a fragment identifier are defined by the set of
            representations that might result from a retrieval action on the
            primary resource. The fragment's format and resolution are
            therefore dependent on the type of a potentially retrieved
            representation, even though such a retrieval is only performed if
            the URI is dereferenced. If no such representation exists, then the
            semantics of the fragment are considered unknown and, effectively,
            unconstrained. Fragment identifier semantics are orthogonal to URI
            schemes and thus cannot be redefined by URI scheme specifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interpretation of the fragment identifier is performed solely by
            the agent that dereferences a URI; the fragment identifier is not
            passed to other systems during the process of retrieval. This means
            that some intermediaries in Web architecture (such as proxies) have
            no interaction with fragment identifiers and that redirection (in
            HTTP [[!HTTP11]], for example) does not account for fragments.

          <h4>
            Fragment identifiers and content negotiation
          </h4>
          <p>
            <dfn>Content negotiation</dfn> refers to the practice of making
            available multiple representations via the same URI. Negotiation
            between the requesting agent and the server determines which
            representation is served (usually with the goal of serving the
            "best" representation a receiving agent can process). HTTP is an
            example of a protocol that enables representation providers to use
            content negotiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individual data formats may define their own rules for use of the
            fragment identifier syntax for specifying different types of
            subsets, views, or external references that are identifiable as
            secondary resources by that media type. Therefore, representation
            providers must manage content negotiation carefully when used with
            a URI that contains a fragment identifier. Consider an example
            where the owner of the URI
            "http://weather.example.com/oaxaca/map#zicatela" uses content
            negotiation to serve two representations of the identified
            resource. Three situations can arise:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The interpretation of "zicatela" is defined consistently by
            both data format specifications. The representation provider
            decides when definitions of fragment identifier semantics are are
            sufficiently consistent.
            </li>
            <li>The interpretation of "zicatela" is defined inconsistently by
            the data format specifications.
            </li>
            <li>The interpretation of "zicatela" is defined in one data format
            specification but not the other.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The first situation—consistent semantics—poses no problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second case is a server management error: representation
            providers must not use content negotiation to serve representation
            formats that have inconsistent fragment identifier semantics. This
            situation also leads to <a href="#URI-collision">URI collision</a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            The third case is not a server management error. It is a means by
            which the Web can grow. Because the Web is a distributed system in
            which formats and agents are deployed in a non-uniform manner, Web
            architecture does not constrain authors to only use "lowest common
            denominator" formats. Content authors may take advantage of new
            data formats while still ensuring reasonable backward-compatibility
            for agents that do not yet implement them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case three, behavior by the receiving agent should vary
            depending on whether the negotiated format defines fragment
            identifier semantics. When a received data format does not define
            fragment identifier semantics, the agent should not perform
            <a href="#no-silent-recovery">silent error recovery</a> unless the
            user has given consent; see [[!CUAP]] for additional suggested
            agent behavior in this case.

          Inconsistencies between Representation Data and Metadata
        </h3>
        <p>
          Successful communication between two parties depends on a reasonably
          shared understanding of the semantics of exchanged messages, both
          data and metadata. At times, there may be inconsistencies between a
          message sender's data and metadata. Examples, observed in practice,
          of inconsistencies between representation data and metadata include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The actual character encoding of a representation (e.g.,
          "iso-8859-1", specified by the <code>encoding</code> attribute in an
          XML declaration) is inconsistent with the charset parameter in the
          representation metadata (e.g., "utf-8", specified by the
          'Content-Type' field in an HTTP header).
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="#xml-namespaces">namespace</a> of the root element
          of XML representation data (e.g., as specified by the "xmlns"
          attribute) is inconsistent with the value of the 'Content-Type' field
          in an HTTP header.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On the other hand, there is no inconsistency in serving HTML content
          with the media type "text/plain", for example, as this combination is
          licensed by specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Receiving agents should detect protocol inconsistencies and perform
          proper <a href="#def-error-recovery">error recovery</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="boxedtext">
          <p>
            <span class="constraintlab">Constraint: <a id=
            "pr-server-auth">Data-metadata inconsistency</a></span>
          </p>
          <p class="constraint">
            Agents MUST NOT ignore message metadata without the consent of the
            user.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Thus, for example, if the parties responsible for
          "weather.example.com" mistakenly label the satellite photo of Oaxaca
          as "image/gif" instead of "image/jpeg", and if Nadia's browser
          detects a problem, Nadia's browser must not ignore the problem (e.g.,
          by simply rendering the JPEG image) without Nadia's consent. Nadia's
          browser can notify Nadia of the problem or notify Nadia and take
          corrective action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, representation providers can help reduce the risk of
          inconsistencies through careful assignment of representation metadata
          (especially that which applies across representations). The section
          on <a href="#xml-media-types">media types for XML</a> presents an
          example of reducing the risk of error by providing no metadata about
          character encoding when serving XML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accuracy of metadata relies on the server administrators, the
          authors of representations, and the software that they use.
          Practically, the capabilities of the tools and the social
          relationships may be the limiting factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accuracy of these and other metadata fields is just as important
          for dynamic Web resources, where a little bit of thought and
          programming can often ensure correct metadata for a huge number of
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often there is a separation of control between the users who create
          representations of resources and the server managers who maintain the
          Web site software. Given that it is generally the Web site software
          that provides the metadata associated with a resource, it follows
          that coordination between the server managers and content creators is
          required.
        </p>
        <div class="boxedtext">

        <p>
          In particular, content creators need to be able to control the
          content type (for extensibility) and the character encoding (for
          proper internationalization).

          Nadia's retrieval of weather information (an example of a read-only
          query or lookup) qualifies as a "safe" interaction; a <dfn>safe
          interaction</dfn> is one where the agent does not incur any
          obligation beyond the interaction. An agent may incur an obligation
          through other means (such as by signing a contract). If an agent does
          not have an obligation before a safe interaction, it does not have
          that obligation afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other Web interactions resemble orders more than queries. These
          <dfn>unsafe interactions</dfn> may cause a change to the state of a
          resource and the user may be held responsible for the consequences of
          these interactions. Unsafe interactions include subscribing to a
          newsletter, posting to a list, or modifying a database.
          <strong>Note:</strong> In this context, the word "unsafe" does not
          necessarily mean "dangerous"; the term "safe" is used in section
          9.1.1 of [[!HTTP11]] and "unsafe" is the natural opposite.

              Nadia decides to book a vacation to Oaxaca at
              "booking.example.com." She enters data into a series of online
              forms and is ultimately asked for credit card information to
              purchase the airline tickets. She provides this information in
              another form. When she presses the "Purchase" button, her browser
              opens another network connection to the server at
              "booking.example.com" and sends a message composed of form data
              using the POST method. This is an <a href=

            <p>
              The server reads the POST request, and after performing the
              booking transaction returns a message to Nadia's browser that
              contains a representation of the results of Nadia's request. The
              representation data is in XHTML so that it can be saved or
              printed out for Nadia's records.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that neither the data transmitted with the POST nor the data

          Safe interactions are important because these are interactions where
          users can browse with confidence and where agents (including search
          engines and browsers that pre-cache data for the user) can follow
          hypertext links safely. Users (or agents acting on their behalf) do
          not commit themselves to anything by querying a resource or following
          a hypertext link.

          For instance, it is incorrect to publish a URI that, when followed as

          Remember that search engines may follow such hypertext links.

        <p>
          The fact that HTTP GET, the access method most often used when
          following a hypertext link, is safe does not imply that all safe
          interactions must be done through HTTP GET. At times, there may be
          good reasons (such as confidentiality requirements or practical
          limits on URI length) to conduct an otherwise safe operation using a
          mechanism generally reserved for unsafe operations (e.g., HTTP POST).

                Nadia pays for her airline tickets online (through a POST
                interaction as described above). She receives a Web page with
                confirmation information and wishes to bookmark it so that she
                can refer to it when she calculates her expenses. Although
                Nadia can print out the results, or save them to a file, she
                would also like to bookmark them.

            Transaction requests and results are valuable resources, and like
            all valuable resources, it is useful to be able to refer to them
            with a <a href="#URI-persistence">persistent URI</a>. However, in
            practice, Nadia cannot bookmark her commitment to pay (expressed
            via the POST request) or the airline company's acknowledgment and
            commitment to provide her with a flight (expressed via the response
            to the POST).

          <p>
            There are ways to provide persistent URIs for transaction requests
            and their results. For transaction requests, user agents can
            provide an interface for managing transactions where the user agent
            has incurred an obligation on behalf of the user. For transaction
            results, HTTP allows representation providers to associate a URI
            with the results of an HTTP POST request using the
            "Content-Location" header (described in section 14.14 of
            [[!HTTP11]]).

              Since Nadia finds the Oaxaca weather site useful, she emails a
              review to her friend Dirk recommending that he check out
              'http://weather.example.com/oaxaca'. Dirk clicks on the resulting
              hypertext link in the email he receives and is frustrated by a
              404 (not found). Dirk tries again the next day and receives a
              representation with "news" that is two-weeks old. He tries one
              more time the next day only to receive a representation that
              claims that the weather in Oaxaca is sunny, even though his
              friends in Oaxaca tell him by phone that in fact it is raining.
              Dirk and Nadia conclude that the URI owners are unreliable or
              unpredictable. Although the URI owner has chosen the Web as a
              communication medium, the owner has lost two customers due to
              ineffective representation management.

          A URI owner may supply zero or more authoritative representations of

          <p>
            As is the case with many human interactions, confidence in
            interactions via the Web depends on stability and predictability.
            For an information resource, persistence depends on the consistency
            of representations. The representation provider decides when
            representations are sufficiently consistent (although that
            determination generally takes user expectations into account).
          </p>
          <p>
            Although persistence in this case is observable as a result of
            representation retrieval, the term <dfn>URI persistence</dfn> is
            used to describe the desirable property that, once associated with
            a resource, a URI should continue indefinitely to refer to that
            resource.

            URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of
            the <a href="#uri-ownership">URI owner</a>. The choice of a
            particular URI scheme provides no guarantee that those URIs will be
            persistent or that they will not be persistent.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTTP [[!HTTP11]] has been designed to help manage URI persistence.
            For example, HTTP redirection (using the 3xx response codes)
            permits servers to tell an agent that further action needs to be
            taken by the agent in order to fulfill the request (for example, a
            new URI is associated with the resource).
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, <a href="#def-coneg">content negotiation</a> also
            promotes consistency, as a site manager is not required to define
            new URIs when adding support for a new format specification.
            Protocols that do not support content negotiation (such as FTP)
            require a new identifier when a new data format is introduced.
            Improper use of content negotiation can lead to inconsistent
            representations.

            It is reasonable to limit access to a resource (for commercial or
            security reasons, for example), but merely identifying the resource
            is like referring to a book by title. In exceptional circumstances,
            people may have agreed to keep titles or URIs confidential (for
            example, a book author and a publisher may agree to keep the URI of
            page containing additional material secret until after the book is
            published), otherwise they are free to exchange them.

            As an analogy: The owners of a building might have a policy that
            the public may only enter the building via the main front door, and
            only during business hours. People who work in the building and who
            make deliveries to it might use other doors as appropriate. Such a
            policy would be enforced by a combination of security personnel and
            mechanical devices such as locks and pass-cards. One would not
            enforce this policy by hiding some of the building entrances, nor
            by requesting legislation requiring the use of the front door and
            forbidding anyone to reveal the fact that there are other doors to
            the building.

            For resources that are generated on demand, machine generation of
            URIs is common. For resources that might usefully be bookmarked for
            later perusal, or shared with others, server managers should avoid
            needlessly restricting the reusability of such URIs. If the
            intention is to restrict information to a particular user, as might
            be the case in a home banking application for example, designers
            should use appropriate <a href="#id-access">access control</a>
            mechanisms.

            Interactions conducted with HTTP POST (where HTTP GET could have
            been used) also limit navigation possibilities. The user cannot
            create a bookmark or share the URI because HTTP POST transactions
            do not typically result in a different URI as the user interacts
            with the site.

        Data Formats
      </h2>
      <p>
        A data format specification (for example, for XHTML, RDF/XML, SMIL,
        XLink, CSS, and PNG) embodies an agreement on the correct
        interpretation of <a href="#def-representation">representation</a>
        data. The first data format used on the Web was HTML. Since then, data
        formats have grown in number. Web architecture does not constrain which
        data formats content providers can use. This flexibility is important
        because there is constant evolution in applications, resulting in new
        data formats and refinements of existing formats. Although Web
        architecture allows for the deployment of new data formats, the
        creation and deployment of new formats (and agents able to handle them)
        is expensive. Thus, before inventing a new data format (or "meta"
        format such as XML), designers should carefully consider re-using one
        that is already available.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a data format to be usefully interoperable between two parties, the
        parties must agree (to a reasonable extent) about its syntax and
        semantics. Shared understanding of a data format promotes
        interoperability but does not imply constraints on usage; for instance,
        a sender of data cannot count on being able to constrain the behavior
        of a data receiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below we describe some characteristics of a data format that facilitate
        integration into Web architecture. This document does not address
        generally beneficial characteristics of a specification such as
        readability, simplicity, attention to programmer goals, attention to
        user needs, accessibility, nor internationalization. The section on
        <a href="#archspecs">architectural specifications</a> includes
        references to additional format specification guidelines.
      </p>
      <section id="binary">
        <h3>
          Binary and Textual Data Formats
        </h3>
        <p>
          Binary data formats are those in which portions of the data are
          encoded for direct use by computer processors, for example 32 bit
          little-endian two's-complement and 64 bit IEEE double-precision
          floating-point. The portions of data so represented include numeric
          values, pointers, and compressed data of all sorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A textual data format is one in which the data is specified in a
          defined encoding as a sequence of characters. HTML, Internet e-mail,
          and all <a href="#xml-formats">XML-based formats</a> are textual.
          Increasingly, internationalized textual data formats refer to the
          Unicode repertoire [[!UNICODE]] for character definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a data format is textual, as defined in this section, that does
          not imply that it should be served with a media type beginning with
          "text/". Although XML-based formats are textual, many XML-based
          formats do not consist primarily of phrases in natural language. See
          the section on <a href="#xml-media-types">media types for XML</a> for
          issues that arise when "text/" is used in conjunction with an
          XML-based format.
        </p>
        <p>
          In principle, all data can be represented using textual formats. In
          practice, some types of content (e.g., audio and video) are generally
          represented using binary formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trade-offs between binary and textual data formats are complex
          and application-dependent. Binary formats can be substantially more
          compact, particularly for complex pointer-rich data structures. Also,
          they can be consumed more rapidly by agents in those cases where they
          can be loaded into memory and used with little or no conversion.
          Note, however, that such cases are relatively uncommon as such direct
          use may open the door to security issues that can only practically be
          addressed by examining every aspect of the data structure in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Textual formats are usually more portable and interoperable. Textual
          formats also have the considerable advantage that they can be
          directly read by human beings (and understood, given sufficient
          documentation). This can simplify the tasks of creating and
          maintaining software, and allow the direct intervention of humans in
          the processing chain without recourse to tools more complex than the
          ubiquitous text editor. Finally, it simplifies the necessary human
          task of learning about new data formats; this is called the "view
          source" effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to emphasize that intuition as to such matters as
          data size and processing speed is not a reliable guide in data format
          design; quantitative studies are essential to a correct understanding
          of the trade-offs. Therefore, designers of a data format
          specification should make a considered choice between binary and
          textual format design.

          In a perfect world, language designers would invent languages that
          perfectly met the requirements presented to them, the requirements
          would be a perfect model of the world, they would never change over
          time, and all implementations would be perfectly interoperable
          because the specifications would have no variability.

          In the real world, language designers imperfectly address the
          requirements as they interpret them, the requirements inaccurately
          model the world, conflicting requirements are presented, and they
          change over time. As a result, designers negotiate with users, make
          compromises, and often introduce extensibility mechanisms so that it
          is possible to work around problems in the short term. In the long
          term, they produce multiple versions of their languages, as the
          problem, and their understanding of it, evolve. The resulting
          variability in specifications, languages, and implementations
          introduces interoperability costs.

                Nadia and Dirk are designing an XML data format to encode data
                about the film industry. They provide for extensibility by
                using XML namespaces and creating a schema that allows the
                inclusion, in certain places, of elements from any namespace.
                When they revise their format, Nadia proposes a new optional
                <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>film</code> element.
                Dirk feels that such a change requires them to assign a new
                namespace name, which might require changes to deployed
                software. Nadia explains to Dirk that their choice of
                extensibility strategy in conjunction with their namespace
                policy allows certain changes that do not affect conformance of
                existing content and software, and thus no change to the
                namespace identifier is required. They chose this policy to
                help them meet their goals of reducing the cost of change.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Dirk and Nadia have chosen a particular namespace change policy
            that allows them to avoid changing the namespace name whenever they
            make changes that do not affect conformance of deployed content and
            software. They might have chosen a different policy, for example
            that any new element or attribute has to belong to a namespace
            other than the original one. Whatever the chosen policy, it should
            set clear expectations for users of the format.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, changing the namespace name of an element completely
            changes the element name. If "a" and "b" are bound to two different
            URIs, <code>a:element</code> and <code>b:element</code> are as
            distinct as <code>a:eieio</code> and <code>a:xyzzy</code>.
            Practically speaking, this means that deployed applications will
            have to be upgraded in order to recognize the new language; the
            cost of this upgrade may be very high.
          </p>
          <p>
            It follows that there are significant tradeoffs to be considered
            when deciding on a namespace change policy. If a vocabulary has no
            extensibility points (that is, if it does not allow elements or
            attributes from foreign namespaces or have a mechanism for dealing
            with unrecognized names from the same namespace), it may be
            absolutely necessary to change the namespace name. Languages that
            allow some form of extensibility without requiring a change to the
            namespace name are more likely to evolve gracefully.

          <p>
            As an example of a change policy designed to reflect the variable
            stability of a namespace, consider the <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/1999/10/nsuri">W3C namespace policy</a> for
            documents on the W3C Recommendation track. The policy sets
            expectations that the Working Group responsible for the namespace
            may modify it in any way until a certain point in the process
            ("Candidate Recommendation") at which point W3C constrains the set
            of possible changes to the namespace in order to promote stable
            implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that since namespace names are URIs, the owner of a namespace
            URI has the authority to decide the namespace change policy.

            Requirements change over time. Successful technologies are adopted
            and adapted by new users. Designers can facilitate the transition
            process by making careful choices about extensibility during the
            design of a language or protocol specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            In making these choices, the designers must weigh the trade-offs
            between extensibility, simplicity, and variability. A language
            without extensibility mechanisms may be simpler and less variable,
            improving initial interoperability. However, it's likely that
            changes to that language will be more difficult, possibly more
            complex and more variable, than if the initial design had provided
            such mechanisms. This may decrease interoperability over the long
            term.

            Extensibility introduces variability which has an impact on
            interoperability. However, languages that have no extensibility
            mechanisms may be extended in ad hoc ways that impact
            interoperability as well. One key criterion of the mechanisms
            provided by language designers is that they allow the extended
            languages to remain in conformance with the original specification,
            increasing the likelihood of interoperability.

            Application needs determine the most appropriate extension strategy
            for a specification. For example, applications designed to operate

            a versioning strategy that would be impractical at the scale of the
            Web.

            Two strategies have emerged as being particularly useful:

          <ol>
            <li>"Must ignore": The agent ignores any content it does not
            recognize.
            </li>
            <li>"Must understand": The agent treats unrecognized markup as an
            error condition.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            A powerful design approach is for the language to allow either form
            of extension, but to distinguish explicitly between them in the
            syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional strategies include prompting the user for more input and
            automatically retrieving data from available hypertext links. More
            complex strategies are also possible, including mixing strategies.
            For instance, a language can include mechanisms for overriding
            standard behavior. Thus, a data format can specify "must ignore"
            semantics but also allow for extensions that override that
            semantics in light of application needs (for instance, with "must
            understand" semantics for a particular extension).
          </p>
          <p>
            Extensibility is not free. Providing hooks for extensibility is one
            of many requirements to be factored into the costs of language
            design. Experience suggests that the long term benefits of a
            well-designed extensibility mechanism generally outweigh the costs.

            Composition of data formats
          </h4>
          <p>
            Many modern data format include mechanisms for composition. For
            example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is possible to embed text comments in some image formats,
            such as JPEG/JFIF. Although these comments are embedded in the
            containing data, they are not intended to affect the display of the
            image.
            </li>
            <li>There are container formats such as SOAP which fully expect
            content from multiple namespaces but which provide an overall
            semantic relationship of message envelope and payload.
            </li>
            <li>The semantics of combining RDF documents containing multiple
            vocabularies are well-defined.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In principle, these relationships can be mixed and nested
            arbitrarily. A SOAP message, for example, can contain an SVG image
            that contains an RDF comment which refers to a vocabulary of terms
            for describing the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note however, that for general XML there is no semantic model that
            defines the interactions within XML documents with elements and/or
            attributes from a variety of namespaces. Each application must
            define how namespaces interact and what effect the namespace of an
            element has on the element's ancestors, siblings, and descendants.

          Separation of Content, Presentation, and Interaction
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Web is a heterogeneous environment where a wide variety of agents
          provide access to content to users with a wide variety of
          capabilities. It is good practice for authors to create content that
          can reach the widest possible audience, including users with
          graphical desktop computers, hand-held devices and mobile phones,
          users with disabilities who may require speech synthesizers, and
          devices not yet imagined. Furthermore, authors cannot predict in some
          cases how an agent will display or process their content. Experience
          shows that the separation of content, presentation, and interaction
          promotes the reuse and device-independence of content; this follows
          from the <a href="#orthogonal-specs">principle of orthogonal
          specifications</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This separation also facilitates reuse of authored source content
          across multiple delivery contexts. Sometimes, functional user
          experiences suited to any delivery context can be generated by using
          an adaptation process applied to a representation that does not
          depend on the access mechanism. For more information about principles
          of device-independence, see [<a href=
          "#DIPRINCIPLES">DIPRINCIPLES</a>].

        <div class="boxedtext">

            <span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="cpi">Separation of

          </p>
          <p class="practice">
            A specification SHOULD allow authors to separate content from both
            presentation and interaction concerns.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Note that when content, presentation, and interaction are separated
          by design, agents need to recombine them. There is a recombination
          spectrum, with "client does all" at one end and "server does all" at
          the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are advantages to each approach. For instance when a client
          (such as a mobile phone) communicates device capabilities to the
          server (for example, using CC/PP), the server can tailor the
          delivered content to fit that client. The server can, for example,
          enable faster downloads by adjusting links to refer to lower
          resolution images, smaller video or no video at all. Similarly, if
          the content has been authored with multiple branches, the server can
          remove unused branches before delivery. In addition, by tailoring the
          content to match the characteristics of a target client, the server
          can help reduce client side computation. However, specializing
          content in this manner reduces caching efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, designing content that that can be recombined on
          the client also tends to make that content applicable to a wider
          range of devices. This design also improves caching efficiency and
          offers users more presentation options. Media-dependent style sheets
          can be used to tailor the content on the client side to particular
          groups of target devices. For textual content with a regular and
          repeating structure, the combined size of the text content plus the
          style sheet is typically less than that of fully recombined content;
          the savings improve further if the style sheet is reused by other
          pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice a combination of both approaches is often used. The
          design decision about where on this spectrum an application should be
          placed depends on the power on the client, the power and the load on
          the server, and the bandwidth of the medium that connects them. If
          the number of possible clients is unbounded, the application will
          scale better if more computation is pushed to the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, it may not be desirable to reach the widest possible
          audience. Designers should consider appropriate technologies, such as
          encryption and <a href="#id-access">access control</a>, for limiting
          the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some data formats are designed to describe presentation (including
          SVG and XSL Formatting Objects). Data formats such as these
          demonstrate that one can only separate content from presentation (or
          interaction) so far; at some point it becomes necessary to talk about
          presentation. Per the principle of <a href=
          "#orthogonal-specs">orthogonal specifications</a> these data formats
          should <em>only</em> address presentation issues.

          A defining characteristic of the Web is that it allows embedded

          hypertext links using absolute URIs (<code>&lt;a

          references (<code>&lt;a href="foo"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a

            Links are commonly expressed using <dfn>URI references</dfn>
            (defined in section 4.2 of [[!URI]]), which may be combined with a
            base URI to yield a usable URI. Section 5.1 of [[!URI]] explains
            different ways to establish a base URI for a resource and
            establishes a precedence among them. For instance, the base URI may
            be a URI for the resource, or specified in a representation (see
            the <code>base</code> elements provided by HTML and XML, and the
            HTTP 'Content-Location' header). See also the section on <a class=

            Agents resolve a URI reference before using the resulting URI to
            interact with another agent. URI references help in content
            management by allowing content authors to design a representation
            locally, i.e., without concern for which global identifier may
            later be used to refer to the associated resource.

            XML defines textual data formats that are naturally suited to
            describing data objects which are hierarchical and processed in a
            chosen sequence. It is widely, but not universally, applicable for
            data formats; an audio or video format, for example, is unlikely to
            be well suited to expression in XML. Design constraints that would
            suggest the use of XML include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Requirement for a hierarchical structure.

            <li>Need for data that can outlive the applications that currently
            process it.
            </li>
            <li>Ability to support internationalization in a self-describing
            way that makes confusion over coding options unlikely.

            Links in XML

          <p>
            Sophisticated linking mechanisms have been invented for XML
            formats. XPointer allows links to address content that does not
            have an explicit, named anchor. [[!XLINK10]] is an appropriate
            specification for representing links in <a href=
            "#hypertext">hypertext</a> XML applications. XLink allows links to
            have multiple ends and to be expressed either inline or in "link
            bases" stored external to any or all of the resources identified by
            the links it contains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designers of XML-based formats may consider using XLink and, for
            defining fragment identifier syntax, using the XPointer framework
            and XPointer element() Schemes.
          </p>
          <p>
            XLink is not the only linking design that has been proposed for
            XML, nor is it universally accepted as a good design. See also TAG
            issue <a href=

          <h4>
            XML namespaces
          </h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of an XML namespace (defined in [<a href=
            "#XMLNS">XMLNS</a>]) is to allow the deployment of XML vocabularies
            (in which element and attribute names are defined) in a global
            environment and to reduce the risk of name collisions in a given
            document when vocabularies are combined. For example, the MathML
            and SVG specifications both define the <code>set</code> element.
            Although XML data from different formats such as MathML and SVG can
            be combined in a single document, in this case there could be
            ambiguity about which <code>set</code> element was intended. XML
            namespaces reduce the risk of name collisions by taking advantage
            of existing systems for allocating globally scoped names: the URI
            system (see also the section on <a class="addrefnb" href=
            "#uri-assignment">URI allocation</a>). When using XML namespaces,
            each local name in an XML vocabulary is paired with a URI (called
            the namespace URI) to distinguish the local name from local names
            in other vocabularies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of URIs confers additional benefits. First, each URI/local
            name pair can be mapped to another URI, grounding the terms of the
            vocabulary in the Web. These terms may be important resources and
            thus it is appropriate to be able to associate URIs with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            For flat namespaces, concatenation is one useful mapping. If
            namespace URIs that end with a hash (“#”) are chosen, then simple
            concatenation of the namespace URI and the local name creates a URI
            for a secondary resource (the identified term). This technique is
            used for many [[!RDFXML]] namespaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other mappings are likely to be more suitable for hierarchical
            namespaces; see the related TAG issue <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#abstractComponentRefs-37">abstractComponentRefs-37</a>.

          <p>
            Designers of XML-based data formats who declare namespaces thus
            make it possible to reuse those data formats and combine them in
            novel ways not yet imagined. Failure to declare namespaces makes
            such reuse more difficult, even impractical in some cases.

              A specification that establishes an XML vocabulary SHOULD place
              all element names and global attribute names in a namespace.

          </div>
          <p>
            Attributes are always scoped by the element on which they appear.
            An attribute that is "global," that is, one that might meaningfully
            appear on elements of many types, including elements in other
            namespaces, should be explicitly placed in a namespace. Local
            attributes, ones associated with only a particular element type,
            need not be included in a namespace since their meaning will always
            be clear from the context provided by that element.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>type</code> attribute from the W3C XML Schema Instance
            namespace "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ([<a href=
            "#XMLSCHEMA">XMLSCHEMA</a>], section 4.3.2) is an example of a
            global attribute. It can be used by authors of any vocabulary to
            make an assertion in instance data about the type of the element on
            which it appears. As a global attribute, it must always be
            qualified. The <code>frame</code> attribute on an HTML table is an
            example of a local attribute. There is no value in placing that
            attribute in a namespace since the attribute is unlikely to be
            useful on an element other than an HTML table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications that rely on DTD processing must impose additional
            constraints on the use of namespaces. DTDs perform validation based
            on the lexical form of the element and attribute names in the
            document. This makes prefixes syntactically significant in ways
            that are not anticipated by [[!XMLNS]].

                Nadia receives representation data from "weather.example.com"

                recognize which XML namespace the elements belong to. Since the
                namespace is identified by the URI
                "http://weather.example.com/2003/format", she asks her browser
                to retrieve a representation of the identified resource. She
                gets back some useful data that allows her to learn more about
                the data format. Nadia's browser may also be able to perform
                some operations automatically (i.e., unattended by a human
                overseer) given data that has been optimized for software
                agents. For example, her browser might, on Nadia's behalf,
                download additional agents to process and render the format.

            Another benefit of using URIs to build XML namespaces is that the
            namespace URI can be used to identify an information resource that
            contains useful information, machine-usable and/or human-usable,
            about terms in the namespace. This type of information resource is
            called a <dfn>namespace document</dfn>. When a namespace URI owner
            provides a namespace document, it is authoritative for the
            namespace.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many reasons to provide a namespace document. A person
            might want to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>understand the purpose of the namespace,

            </li>
            <li>find out who controls it and associated policies,
            </li>
            <li>request authority to access schemas or collateral material
            about it, or
            </li>
            <li>report a bug or situation that could be considered an error in
            some collateral material.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A processor might want to:

          <ul>
            <li>retrieve a schema, for validation,
            </li>
            <li>retrieve a style sheet, for presentation, or

          <p>
            In general, there is no established best practice for creating
            representations of a namespace document; application expectations
            will influence what data format or formats are used. Application
            expectations will also influence whether relevant information

            Section 3 of "Namespaces in XML" [<a href="#XMLNS">XMLNS</a>]
            provides a syntactic construct known as a QName for the compact
            expression of qualified names in XML documents. A qualified name is
            a pair consisting of a URI, which names a namespace, and a local
            name placed within that namespace. "Namespaces in XML" provides for
            the use of QNames as names for XML elements and attributes.

          <p>
            Other specifications, starting with [<a href="#XSLT10">XSLT10</a>],
            have employed the idea of using QNames in contexts other than
            element and attribute names, for example in attribute values and in
            element content. However, general XML processors cannot reliably
            recognize QNames as such when they are used in attribute values and
            in element content; for example, the syntax of QNames overlaps with
            that of URIs. Experience has also revealed other limitations to
            QNames, such as losing namespace bindings after XML
            canonicalization.

            Because QNames are compact, some specification designers have
            adopted the same syntax as a means of identifying resources. Though
            convenient as a shorthand notation, this usage has a cost. There is
            no single, accepted way to convert a QName into a URI or vice
            versa. Although QNames are convenient, they do not replace the URI
            as the identification system of the Web. The use of QNames to
            identify Web resources without providing a mapping to URIs is
            inconsistent with Web architecture.

            XML ID semantics
          </h4>
          <p>
            Consider the following fragment of XML: <code>&lt;section
            &gt;</code>. Does the <code>section</code> element have what the
            XML Recommendation refers to as the ID <code>foo</code> (i.e.,
            "foo" must not appear in the surrounding XML document more than
            once)? One cannot answer this question by examining the element and
            its attributes alone. In XML, the quality of "being an ID" is
            associated with the type of an attribute, not its name. Finding the
            IDs in a document requires additional processing.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Processing the document with a processor that recognizes DTD
            attribute list declarations (in the external or internal subset)
            might reveal a declaration that identifies the <code>name</code>
            attribute as an ID. <strong>Note:</strong> This processing is not
            necessarily part of validation. A non-validating, DTD-aware
            processor can recognize IDs.
            </li>
            <li>Processing the document with a W3C XML schema might reveal an
            element declaration that identifies the <code>name</code> attribute
            as an W3C XML Schema <code>ID</code>.
            </li>
            <li>In practice, processing the document with another schema
            language, such as RELAX NG [<a href="#RELAXNG">RELAXNG</a>], might
            reveal the attributes declared to be of ID in the XML Schema sense.
            Many modern specifications begin processing XML at the Infoset
            [<a href="#INFOSET">INFOSET</a>] level and do not specify
            normatively how an Infoset is constructed. For those
            specifications, any process that establishes the ID type in the
            Infoset (and Post Schema Validation Infoset (<abbr>PSVI</abbr>)
            defined in [<a href="#XMLSCHEMA">XMLSCHEMA</a>]) may usefully
            identify the attributes of type ID.
            </li>
            <li>In practice, applications may have independent means (such as
            those defined in the XPointer specification, [<a href=
            "#XPTRFR">XPTRFR</a>] <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/#shorthand">
              section 3.2</a>) of locating identifiers inside a document.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To further complicate matters, DTDs establish the ID type in the
            Infoset whereas W3C XML Schema produces a PSVI but does not modify
            the original Infoset. This leaves open the possibility that a
            processor might only look in the Infoset and consequently would
            fail to recognize schema-assigned IDs.

            Media types for XML
          </h4>
          <p>
            RFC 3023 defines the Internet media types "application/xml" and
            "text/xml", and describes a convention whereby XML-based data
            formats use Internet media types with a "+xml" suffix, for example
            "image/svg+xml".
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two problems associated with the “text” media types:
            First, for data identified as "text/*", Web intermediaries are
            allowed to "transcode", i.e., convert one character encoding to
            another. Transcoding may make the self-description false or may
            cause the document to be not well-formed.
          </p>
          <div class="boxedtext">
            <p>
              <span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="no-text-xml">XML

              In general, a representation provider SHOULD NOT assign Internet

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Second, representations whose Internet media types begin with
            "text/" are required, unless the <code>charset</code> parameter is
            specified, to be considered to be encoded in US-ASCII. Since the
            syntax of XML is designed to make documents self-describing, it is
            good practice to omit the <code>charset</code> parameter, and since
            XML is very often not encoded in US-ASCII, the use of "text/"
            Internet media types effectively precludes this good practice.

          <p>
            The section on <a href="#media-type-fragid">media types and
            fragment identifier semantics</a> discusses the interpretation of
            fragment identifiers. Designers of an XML-based data format
            specification should define the semantics of fragment identifiers
            in that format. The XPointer Framework [<a href=
            "#XPTRFR">XPTRFR</a>] provides an interoperable starting point.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the media type assigned to representation data is
            "application/xml", there are no semantics defined for fragment
            identifiers, and authors should not make use of fragment
            identifiers in such data. The same is true if the assigned media
            type has the suffix "+xml" (defined in "XML Media Types" [<a href=
            "#RFC3023">RFC3023</a>]), and the data format specification does
            not specify fragment identifier semantics. In short, just knowing
            that content is XML does not provide information about fragment
            identifier semantics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people assume that the fragment identifier <code>#abc</code>,
            when referring to XML data, identifies the element in the document
            with the ID "abc". However, there is no normative support for this
            assumption. A revision of RFC 3023 is expected to address this.

          Orthogonal Specifications
        </h3>
        <p>
          Identification, interaction, and representation are orthogonal
          concepts, meaning that technologies used for identification,
          interaction, and representation may evolve independently. For
          instance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resources are identified with URIs. URIs can be published without
          building any representations of the resource or determining whether
          any representations are available.
          </li>
          <li>A generic URI syntax allows agents to function in many cases
          without knowing specifics of URI schemes.
          </li>
          <li>In many cases one may change the representation of a resource
          without disrupting references to the resource (for example, by using
          <a href="#def-coneg">content negotiation</a>).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When two specifications are orthogonal, one may change one without
          requiring changes to the other, even if one has dependencies on the
          other. For example, although the HTTP specification depends on the
          URI specification, the two may evolve independently. This
          orthogonality increases the flexibility and robustness of the Web.
          For example, one may refer by URI to an image without knowing
          anything about the format chosen to represent the image. This has
          facilitated the introduction of image formats such as PNG and SVG
          without disrupting existing references to image resources.

        <p>
          Experience demonstrates that problems arise where orthogonal concepts
          occur in a single specification. Consider, for example, the HTML
          specification which includes the orthogonal x-www-form-urlencoded
          specification. Software developers (for example, of [<a href=
          "#CGI">CGI</a>] applications) might have an easier time finding the
          specification if it were published separately and then cited from the
          HTTP, URI, and HTML specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problems also arise when specifications attempt to modify orthogonal
          abstractions described elsewhere. An <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/global.html">historical
          version</a> of the HTML specification added a "<code>Refresh</code>"
          value to the <code>http-equiv</code> attribute of the
          <code>meta</code> element. It was defined to be equivalent to the
          HTTP header of the same name. The authors of the HTTP specification
          ultimately decided not to provide this header and that made the two
          specifications awkwardly at odds with each other. The W3C HTML
          Working Group eventually removed the "<code>Refresh</code>" value.
        </p>

          A specification should clearly indicate which features overlap with
          those governed by another specification.

          An example of an unsuccessful extension mechanism is HTTP mandatory
          extensions [<a href="#HTTPEXT">HTTPEXT</a>]. The community has sought
          mechanisms to extend HTTP, but apparently the costs of the mandatory
          extension proposal (notably in complexity) outweighed the benefits
          and thus hampered adoption.

          Below we discuss the property of "extensibility," exhibited by URIs,

          <dfn>Subset language</dfn>: one language is a subset (or "profile")
          of a second language if any document in the first language is also a
          valid document in the second language and has the same interpretation
          in the second language.
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn>Extended language</dfn>: If one language is a subset of another,
          the latter superset is called an extended language; the difference
          between the languages is called the extension. Clearly, extending a
          language is better for interoperability than creating an incompatible
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, many instances of a superset language can be safely and
          usefully processed as though they were in the subset language.
          Languages that can evolve this way, allowing applications to provide
          new information when necessary while still interoperating with
          applications that only understand a subset of the current language,
          are said to be "extensible." Language designers can facilitate
          extensibility by defining the default behavior of unknown
          extensions—for example, that they be ignored (in some defined way) or
          should be considered errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, from early on in the Web, HTML agents followed the
          convention of ignoring unknown tags. This choice left room for
          innovation (i.e., non-standard elements) and encouraged the
          deployment of HTML. However, interoperability problems arose as well.
          In this type of environment, there is an inevitable tension between
          interoperability in the short term and the desire for extensibility.
          Experience shows that designs that strike the right balance between
          allowing change and preserving interoperability are more likely to
          thrive and are less likely to disrupt the Web community. <a href=

          Error Handling
        </h3>
        <p>
          Errors occur in networked information systems. An error condition can
          be well-characterized (e.g., well-formedness errors in XML or 4xx
          client errors in HTTP) or arise unpredictably. <dfn>Error
          correction</dfn> means that an agent repairs a condition so that
          within the system, it is as though the error never occurred. One
          example of error correction involves data retransmission in response
          to a temporary network failure. <dfn>Error recovery</dfn> means that
          an agent does not repair an error condition but continues processing
          by addressing the fact that the error has occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agents frequently <em>correct</em> errors without user awareness,
          sparing users the details of complex network communications. On the
          other hand, it is important that agents <em>recover</em> from error
          in a way that is evident to users, since the agents are acting on
          their behalf.

          To promote interoperability, specification designers should identify
          predictable error conditions. Experience has led to the following
          observations about error-handling approaches.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protocol designers should provide enough information about an
          error condition so that an agent can address the error condition. For
          instance, an HTTP 404 status code (not found) is useful because it
          allows user agents to present relevant information to users, enabling
          them to contact the representation provider in case of problems.
          </li>
          <li>Experience with the cost of building a user agent to handle the
          diverse forms of ill-formed HTML content convinced the designers of
          the XML specification to require that agents fail upon encountering
          ill-formed content. Because users are unlikely to tolerate such
          failures, this design choice has pressured all parties into
          respecting XML's constraints, to the benefit of all.
          </li>
          <li>An agent that encounters unrecognized content may handle it in a
          number of ways, including by considering it an error; see also the
          section on <a class="addrefnb" href="#ext-version">extensibility and
          versioning</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Error behavior that is appropriate for a person may not be
          appropriate for software. People are capable of exercising judgement
          in ways that software applications generally cannot. An informal
          error response may suffice for a person but not for a processor.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Protocol-based Interoperability
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Web follows Internet tradition in that its important interfaces
          are defined in terms of protocols, by specifying the syntax,
          semantics, and sequencing constraints of the messages interchanged.
          Protocols designed to be resilient in the face of widely varying
          environments have helped the Web scale and have facilitated
          communication across multiple trust boundaries. Traditional
          application programming interfaces (<abbr>APIs</abbr>) do not always
          take these constraints into account, nor should they be required to.
          One effect of protocol-based design is that the technology shared
          among agents often lasts longer than the agents themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is common for programmers working with the Web to write code that
          generates and parses these messages directly. It is less common, but
          not unusual, for end users to have direct exposure to these messages.
          It is often desirable to provide users with access to format and
          protocol details: allowing them to “view source,” whereby they may
          gain expertise in the workings of the underlying system.

            "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software
            Architectures", Doctoral Thesis of R. T. Fielding, 2000. Designers
            of protocol specifications in particular should invest time in
            understanding the REST model and the relevance of its principles to
            a given design. These principles include statelessness, clear
            assignment of roles to parties, uniform address space, and a
            limited, uniform set of verbs. Available at
