<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> (<dfn><abbr>WWW</abbr></dfn>, or
simply <dfn><abbr>Web</abbr></dfn>) is an information space in
which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are
identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource
Identifiers (<dfn><abbr>URI</abbr></dfn>).</p>
<p>Examples such as the following <dfn>travel scenario</dfn> are
used throughout this document to illustrate typical behavior of
<dfn>Web agents</dfn>—people or software acting on this information
space. A <dfn>user agent</dfn> acts on behalf of a user. Software
agents include servers, proxies, spiders, browsers, and multimedia
players.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="storylab">Story</span></p>
<div class="story">
<p>While planning a trip to Mexico, Nadia reads “Oaxaca weather
information: 'http://weather.example.com/oaxaca'” in a glossy
travel magazine. Nadia has enough experience with the Web to
recognize that &quot;http://weather.example.com/oaxaca&quot; is a URI and
that she is likely to be able to retrieve associated information
with her Web browser. When Nadia enters the URI into her
browser:</p>
<ol>
<li>The browser recognizes that what Nadia typed is a URI.</li>
<li>The browser performs an information retrieval action in
accordance with its configured behavior for resources identified
via the &quot;http&quot; URI scheme.</li>
<li>The authority responsible for &quot;weather.example.com&quot; provides
information in a response to the retrieval request.</li>
<li>The browser interprets the response, identified as XHTML by the
server, and performs additional retrieval actions for inline
graphics and other content as necessary.</li>
<li>The browser displays the retrieved information, which includes
hypertext links to other information. Nadia can follow these
hypertext links to retrieve additional information.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>This scenario illustrates the three architectural bases of the
Web that are discussed in this document:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a>Identification</a>. URIs are used to identify resources. In
this travel scenario, the resource is a periodically updated report
on the weather in Oaxaca, and the URI is
“http://weather.example.com/oaxaca”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a>Interaction</a>. Web agents communicate using standardized
protocols that enable interaction through the exchange of messages
which adhere to a defined syntax and semantics. By entering a URI
into a retrieval dialog or selecting a hypertext link, Nadia tells
her browser to perform a retrieval action for the resource
identified by the URI. In this example, the browser sends an HTTP
GET request (part of the HTTP protocol) to the server at
&quot;weather.example.com&quot;, via TCP/IP port 80, and the server sends
back a message containing what it determines to be a representation
of the resource as of the time that representation was generated.
Note that this example is specific to hypertext browsing of
information—other kinds of interaction are possible, both within
browsers and through the use of other types of Web agent; our
example is intended to illustrate one common interaction, not
define the range of possible interactions or limit the ways in
which agents might use the Web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a>Formats</a>. Most protocols used for representation retrieval
and/or submission make use of a sequence of one or more messages,
which taken together contain a payload of representation data and
metadata, to transfer the representation between agents. The choice
of interaction protocol places limits on the formats of
representation data and metadata that can be transmitted. HTTP, for
example, typically transmits a single octet stream plus metadata,
and uses the &quot;Content-Type&quot; and &quot;Content-Encoding&quot; header fields to
further identify the format of the representation. In this
scenario, the representation transferred is in XHTML, as identified
by the &quot;Content-type&quot; HTTP header field containing the registered
Internet media type name, &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;. That Internet
media type name indicates that the representation data can be
processed according to the XHTML specification.</p>
<p>Nadia's browser is configured and programmed to interpret the
receipt of an &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; typed representation as an
instruction to render the content of that representation according
to the XHTML rendering model, including any subsidiary interactions
(such as requests for external style sheets or in-line images)
called for by the representation. In the scenario, the XHTML
representation data received from the initial request instructs
Nadia's browser to also retrieve and render in-line the weather
maps, each identified by a URI and thus causing an additional
retrieval action, resulting in additional representations that are
processed by the browser according to their own data formats (e.g.,
&quot;application/svg+xml&quot; indicates the SVG data format), and this
process continues until all of the data formats have been rendered.
The result of all of this processing, once the browser has reached
an application steady-state that completes Nadia's initial
requested action, is commonly referred to as a &quot;Web page&quot;.</p>

identifier, resource, and representation.</p>

<h3>About this Document</h3>
<p>This document describes the properties we desire of the Web and
the design choices that have been made to achieve them. It promotes
the reuse of existing standards when suitable, and gives guidance
on how to innovate in a manner consistent with Web
architecture.</p>
<p>The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are used
in the principles, constraints, and good practice notes in
accordance with RFC 2119 [[!RFC2119]].</p>
<p>This document does not include conformance provisions for these
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conforming software is expected to be so diverse that it would
not be useful to be able to refer to the class of conforming
software agents.</li>
<li>Some of the good practice notes concern people; specifications
generally define conformance for software, not people.</li>
<li>We do not believe that the addition of a conformance section is
likely to increase the utility of the document.</li>

<h4>Audience of this Document</h4>
<p>This document is intended to inform discussions about issues of
Web architecture. The intended audience for this document
includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Participants in W3C Activities</li>
<li>Other groups and individuals designing technologies to be
integrated into the Web</li>
<li>Implementers of W3C specifications</li>
<li>Web content authors and publishers</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This document does not distinguish in any
formal way the terms &quot;language&quot; and &quot;format.&quot; Context determines
which term is used. The phrase &quot;specification designer&quot; encompasses
language, format, and protocol designers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4>Scope of this Document</h4>
<p>This document presents the general architecture of the Web.
Other groups inside and outside W3C also address specialized
aspects of Web architecture, including accessibility, quality
assurance, internationalization, device independence, and Web
Services. The section on <a>Architectural Specifications</a>
includes references to these related specifications.</p>
<p>This document strives for a balance between brevity and
precision while including illustrative examples. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/findings">TAG findings</a> are
informational documents that complement the current document by
providing more detail about selected topics. This document includes
some excerpts from the findings. Since the findings evolve
independently, this document includes references to approved TAG
findings. For other TAG issues covered by this document but without
an approved finding, references are to entries in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html">TAG issues list</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the examples in this document that involve human
activity suppose the familiar Web interaction model (illustrated at
the beginning of the Introduction) where a person follows a link
via a user agent, the user agent retrieves and presents data, the
user follows another link, etc. This document does not discuss in
any detail other interaction models such as voice browsing (see,
for example, [[!VOICEXML2]]). The choice of interaction model may
have an impact on expected agent behavior. For instance, when a
graphical user agent running on a laptop computer or hand-held
device encounters an error, the user agent can report errors
directly to the user through visual and audio cues, and present the
user with options for resolving the errors. On the other hand, when
someone is browsing the Web through voice input and audio-only
output, stopping the dialog to wait for user input may reduce
usability since it is so easy to &quot;lose one's place&quot; when browsing
with only audio-output. This document does not discuss how the
principles, constraints, and good practices identified here apply
in all interaction contexts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4>Principles, Constraints, and Good Practice Notes</h4>
<p>The important points of this document are categorized as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Principle</dt>
<dd>An architectural principle is a fundamental rule that applies
to a large number of situations and variables. Architectural
principles include &quot;separation of concerns&quot;, &quot;generic interface&quot;,
&quot;self-descriptive syntax,&quot; &quot;visible semantics,&quot; &quot;network effect&quot;
(Metcalfe's Law), and Amdahl's Law: &quot;The speed of a system is
limited by its slowest component.&quot;</dd>
<dt>Constraint</dt>
<dd>In the design of the Web, some choices, like the names of the
<code>p</code> and <code>li</code> elements in HTML, the choice of
the colon (:) character in URIs, or grouping bits into eight-bit
units (octets), are somewhat arbitrary; if <code>paragraph</code>
had been chosen instead of <code>p</code> or asterisk (*) instead
of colon, the large-scale result would, most likely, have been the
same. This document focuses on more fundamental design choices:
design choices that lead to constraints, i.e., restrictions in
behavior or interaction within the system. Constraints may be
imposed for technical, policy, or other reasons to achieve
desirable properties in the system, such as accessibility, global
scope, relative ease of evolution, efficiency, and dynamic
extensibility.</dd>
<dt>Good practice</dt>
<dd>Good practice—by software developers, content authors, site
managers, users, and specification designers—increases the value of
the Web.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="identification" class="section">
<h2>Identification</h2>
<p>In order to communicate internally, a community agrees (to a
reasonable extent) on a set of terms and their meanings. One goal
of the Web, since its inception, has been to build a global
community in which any party can share information with any other
party. To achieve this goal, the Web makes use of a single global
identification system: the URI. URIs are a cornerstone of Web
architecture, providing identification that is common across the
Web. The global scope of URIs promotes large-scale &quot;network
effects&quot;: the value of an identifier increases the more it is used
consistently (for example, the more it is used in <a>hypertext
links</a>).</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="principlelab">Principle: <a id="pr-global-id">Global Identifiers</a></span></p>
<p class="principle">Global naming leads to global network
effects.</p>
</div>
<p>This principle dates back at least as far as Douglas Engelbart's
seminal work on open hypertext systems; see section <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/augment-132082.htm#11K">Every
Object Addressable</a> in [[!Eng90]].</p>
<div id="uri-benefits" class="section">
<h3>Benefits of URIs</h3>
<p>The choice of syntax for global identifiers is somewhat
arbitrary; it is their global scope that is important. The
<dfn>Uniform Resource Identifier</dfn>, [[!URI]], has been
successfully deployed since the creation of the Web. There are
substantial benefits to participating in the existing network of
URIs, including linking, bookmarking, caching, and indexing by
search engines, and there are substantial costs to creating a new
identification system that has the same properties as URIs.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-use-uris">Identify with URIs</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">To benefit from and increase the value of the
World Wide Web, agents should provide URIs as identifiers for
resources.</p>
</div>
<p>A resource should have an associated URI if another party might
reasonably want to create a hypertext link to it, make or refute
assertions about it, retrieve or cache a representation of it,
include all or part of it by reference into another representation,
annotate it, or perform other operations on it. Software developers
should expect that sharing URIs across applications will be useful,
even if that utility is not initially evident. The TAG finding
<cite>&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html">URIs,
Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST</a>&quot;</cite>
discusses additional benefits and considerations of URI
addressability.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some URI schemes (such as the &quot;ftp&quot; URI
scheme specification) use the term &quot;designate&quot; where this document
uses &quot;identify.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div id="id-resources" class="section">
<h3>URI/Resource Relationships</h3>
<p>By design a URI identifies one resource. We do not limit the
scope of what might be a <dfn>resource</dfn>. The term &quot;resource&quot;
is used in a general sense for whatever might be identified by a
URI. It is conventional on the hypertext Web to describe Web pages,
images, product catalogs, etc. as “resources”. The distinguishing
characteristic of these resources is that all of their essential
characteristics can be conveyed in a message. We identify this set
as “<dfn>information resources</dfn>.”</p>
<p>This document is an example of an information resource. It
consists of words and punctuation symbols and graphics and other
artifacts that can be encoded, with varying degrees of fidelity,
into a sequence of bits. There is nothing about the essential
information content of this document that cannot in principle be
transfered in a message. In the case of this document, the message
payload is the <a>representation</a> of this document.</p>
<p>However, our use of the term resource is intentionally more
broad. Other things, such as cars and dogs (and, if you've printed
this document on physical sheets of paper, the artifact that you
are holding in your hand), are resources too. They are not
information resources, however, because their essence is not
information. Although it is possible to describe a great many
things about a car or a dog in a sequence of bits, the sum of those
things will invariably be an approximation of the essential
character of the resource.</p>
<p>We define the term “information resource” because we observe
that it is useful in discussions of Web technology and may be
useful in constructing specifications for facilities built for use
on the Web.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="constraintlab">Constraint: <a id="pr-uri-collision">URIs Identify a Single Resource</a></span></p>
<p class="constraint">Assign distinct URIs to distinct
resources.</p>
</div>
<p>Since the scope of a URI is global, the resource identified by a
URI does not depend on the context in which the URI appears (see
also the section about <a class="section">indirect
identification</a>).</p>
<p>[[!URI]] is an agreement about how the Internet community
allocates names and associates them with the resources they
identify. URIs are divided into <a>schemes</a> that define, via
their scheme specification, the mechanism by which scheme-specific
identifiers are associated with resources. For example, the &quot;http&quot;
URI scheme ([[!RFC2616]]) uses DNS and TCP-based HTTP servers for
the purpose of identifier allocation and resolution. As a result,
identifiers such as &quot;http://example.com/somepath#someFrag&quot; often
take on meaning through the community experience of performing an
HTTP GET request on the identifier and, if given a successful
response, interpreting the response as a representation of the
identified resource. (See also <a>Fragment Identifiers</a>.) Of
course, a retrieval action like GET is not the only way to obtain
information about a resource. One might also publish a document
that purports to define the meaning of a particular URI. These
other sources of information may suggest meanings for such
identifiers, but it's a local policy decision whether those
suggestions should be heeded.</p>
<p>Just as one might wish to refer to a person by different names
(by full name, first name only, sports nickname, romantic nickname,
and so forth), Web architecture allows the association of more than
one URI with a resource. URIs that identify the same resource are
called <dfn>URI aliases</dfn>. The section on <a>URI aliases</a>
discusses some of the potential costs of creating multiple URIs for
the same resource.</p>
<p>Several sections of this document address questions about the
relationship between URIs and resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much can I tell about a resource by inspection of a URI
that identifies it? See the sections on <a>URI schemes</a> and
<a>URI opacity</a>.</li>
<li>Who determines what resource a URI identifies? See the section
on <a>URI allocation</a>.</li>
<li>Can the resource identified by a URI change over time? See the
sections on <a>URI persistence</a> and <a>representation
management</a> .</li>
<li>Since more than one URI can identify the same resource, how do
I know which URIs identify the same resource? See the sections on
<a>URI comparison</a> and <a>assertions that two URIs identify the
same resource</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
<h4 id="URI-collision">URI collision</h4>
<p>By design, a URI identifies one resource. Using the same URI to
directly identify different resources produces a <dfn>URI
collision</dfn>. Collision often imposes a cost in communication
due to the effort required to resolve ambiguities.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that one organization makes use of a URI
to refer to the movie <cite>The Sting</cite>, and another
organization uses the same URI to refer to a discussion forum about
<cite>The Sting</cite>. To a third party, aware of both
organizations, this collision creates confusion about what the URI
identifies, undermining the value of the URI. If one wanted to talk
about the creation date of the resource identified by the URI, for
instance, it would not be clear whether this meant &quot;when the movie
was created&quot; or &quot;when the discussion forum about the movie was
created.&quot;</p>
<p>Social and technical solutions have been devised to help avoid
URI collision. However, the success or failure of these different
approaches depends on the extent to which there is consensus in the
Internet community on abiding by the defining specifications.</p>
<p>The section on <a class="addrefnb">URI allocation</a> examines
approaches for establishing the authoritative source of information
about what resource a URI identifies.</p>
<p>URIs are sometimes used for <a>indirect identification</a>. This
does not necessarily lead to collisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="uri-assignment" class="section">
<h4>URI allocation</h4>
<p>URI allocation is the process of associating a URI with a
resource. Allocation can be performed both by resource owners and
by other parties. It is important to avoid <a>URI
collision</a>.</p>
<div id="uri-ownership" class="section">
<h5>URI ownership</h5>
<p><dfn>URI ownership</dfn> is a relation between a URI and a
social entity, such as a person, organization, or specification.
URI ownership gives the relevant social entity certain rights,
including:</p>
<ol>
<li>to pass on ownership of some or all owned URIs to another
owner—delegation; and</li>
<li>to associate a resource with an owned URI—URI allocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>By social convention, URI ownership is delegated from the IANA
URI scheme registry [[!IANASchemes]], itself a social entity, to
IANA-registered URI scheme specifications. Some URI scheme
specifications further delegate ownership to subordinate registries
or to other nominated owners, who may further delegate ownership.
In the case of a specification, ownership ultimately lies with the
community that maintains the specification.</p>
<p>The approach taken for the &quot;http&quot; URI scheme, for example,
follows the pattern whereby the Internet community delegates
authority, via the IANA URI scheme registry and the DNS, over a set
of URIs with a common prefix to one particular owner. One
consequence of this approach is the Web's heavy reliance on the
central DNS registry. A different approach is taken by the URN
Syntax scheme [[!RFC2141] which delegates ownership of portions of
URN space to URN Namespace specifications which themselves are
registered in an IANA-maintained registry of URN Namespace
Identifiers.</p>
<p>URI owners are responsible for avoiding the assignment of
equivalent URIs to multiple resources. Thus, if a URI scheme
specification does provide for the delegation of individual or
organized sets of URIs, it should take pains to ensure that
ownership ultimately resides in the hands of a single social
entity. Allowing multiple owners increases the likelihood of URI
collisions.</p>
<p>URI owners may organize or deploy infrastruture to ensure that
representations of associated resources are available and, where
appropriate, interaction with the resource is possible through the
exchange of representations. There are social expectations for
responsible <a class="addrefnb">representation management</a> by
URI owners. Additional social implications of URI ownership are not
discussed here.</p>
<p>See TAG issue <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#siteData-36">siteData-36</a>,
which concerns the expropriation of naming authority.</p>
</div>
<div id="assign-other-schemes" class="section">
<h5>Other allocation schemes</h5>
<p>Some schemes use techniques other than delegated ownership to
avoid collision. For example, the specification for the data URL
(sic) scheme [[!RFC2397]] specifies that the resource identified by
a data scheme URI has only one possible representation. The
representation data makes up the URI that identifies that resource.
Thus, the specification itself determines how data URIs are
allocated; no delegation is possible.</p>
<p>Other schemes (such as &quot;news:comp.text.xml&quot;) rely on a social
process.</p>

</div>
<div id="indirect-identification" class="section">
<h4>Indirect Identification</h4>
<p>To say that the URI &quot;mailto:nadia@example.com&quot; identifies both
an Internet mailbox and Nadia, the person, introduces a URI
collision. However, we can use the URI to indirectly identify
Nadia. Identifiers are commonly used in this way.</p>
<p>Listening to a news broadcast, one might hear a report on
Britain that begins, &quot;Today, 10 Downing Street announced a series
of new economic measures.&quot; Generally, &quot;10 Downing Street&quot;
identifies the official residence of Britain's Prime Minister. In
this context, the news reporter is using it (as English rhetoric
allows) to indirectly identify the British government. Similarly,
URIs identify resources, but they can also be used in many
constructs to indirectly identify other resources. Globally adopted
assignment policies make some URIs appealing as general-purpose
identifiers. Local policy establishes what they indirectly
identify.</p>
<p>Suppose that <code>nadia@example.com</code> is Nadia's email
address. The organizers of a conference Nadia attends might use
&quot;mailto:nadia@example.com&quot; to refer indirectly to her (e.g., by
using the URI as a database key in their database of conference
participants). This does not introduce a URI collision.</p>

<div id="identifiers-comparison" class="section">
<h3>URI Comparisons</h3>
<p>URIs that are identical, character-by-character, refer to the
same resource. Since Web Architecture allows the association of
multiple URIs with a given resource, two URIs that are not
character-by-character identical may still refer to the same
resource. Different URIs do not necessarily refer to different
resources but there is generally a higher computational cost to
determine that different URIs refer to the same resource.</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of a false negative (i.e., an incorrect
conclusion that two URIs do not refer to the same resource) or a
false positive (i.e., an incorrect conclusion that two URIs do
refer to the same resource), some specifications describe
equivalence tests in addition to character-by-character comparison.
Agents that reach conclusions based on comparisons that are not
licensed by the relevant specifications take responsibility for any
problems that result; see the section on <a class="addrefnb">error
handling</a> for more information about responsible behavior when
reaching unlicensed conclusions. Section 6 of [[!URI]] provides
more information about comparing URIs and reducing the risk of
false negatives and positives.</p>

resource</a>.</p>
<div id="uri-aliases" class="section">
<h4>URI aliases</h4>
<p>Although there are benefits (such as naming flexibility) to URI
aliases, there are also costs. URI aliases are harmful when they
divide the Web of related resources. A corollary of Metcalfe's
Principle (the &quot;network effect&quot;) is that the value of a given
resource can be measured by the number and value of other resources
in its network neighborhood, that is, the resources that link to
it.</p>
<p>The problem with aliases is that if half of the neighborhood
points to one URI for a given resource, and the other half points
to a second, different URI for that same resource, the neighborhood
is divided. Not only is the aliased resource undervalued because of
this split, the entire neighborhood of resources loses value
because of the missing second-order relationships that should have
existed among the referring resources by virtue of their references
to the aliased resource.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="avoid-uri-aliases">Avoiding URI aliases</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A URI owner SHOULD NOT associate arbitrarily
different URIs with the same resource.</p>
</div>
<p>URI consumers also have a role in ensuring URI consistency. For
instance, when transcribing a URI, agents should not gratuitously
percent-encode characters. The term &quot;character&quot; refers to URI
characters as defined in section 2 of [[!URI]]; percent-encoding is
discussed in section 2.1 of that specification.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">

</div>
<p>When a URI alias does become common currency, the <a href="#uri-ownership">URI owner</a> should use protocol techniques such
as server-side redirects to relate the two resources. The community
benefits when the URI owner supports redirection of an aliased URI
to the corresponding &quot;official&quot; URI. For more information on
redirection, see section 10.3, Redirection, in [[!RFC2616]]. See

<p>Dirk would like to add a link from his Web site to the Oaxaca

setting misleading expectations for the URI he has used. The Oaxaca
weather site policy is that the URI in question identifies a report
on the current weather in Oaxaca—on any given day—and not the
weather on 1 August. Of course, on the first of August in 2004,
Dirk's link will be correct, but the rest of the time he will be
misleading readers. Nadia points out to Dirk that the managers of
the Oaxaca weather site do make available a different URI
permanently assigned to a resource reporting on the weather on 1

</div>
</div>
<p>In this story, there are two resources: “a report on the current
weather in Oaxaca” and “a report on the weather in Oaxaca on
1 August 2004”. The managers of the Oaxaca weather site
assign two URIs to these two different resources. On
1 August 2004, the representations for these resources
are identical. That fact that dereferencing two different URIs
produces identical representations does not imply that the two URIs
are aliases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="URI-scheme" class="section">
<h3>URI Schemes</h3>
<p>In the URI &quot;http://weather.example.com/&quot;, the &quot;http&quot; that
appears before the colon (&quot;:&quot;) names a URI scheme. Each URI scheme
has a specification that explains the scheme-specific details of
how scheme identifiers are allocated and become associated with a
resource. The URI syntax is thus a federated and extensible naming
system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict the
syntax and semantics of identifiers within that scheme.</p>
<p>Examples of URIs from various schemes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>mailto:joe@example.org</li>
<li>ftp://example.org/aDirectory/aFile</li>
<li>news:comp.infosystems.www</li>
<li>tel:+1-816-555-1212</li>
<li>ldap://ldap.example.org/c=GB?objectClass?one</li>
<li>urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog</li>
</ul>
<p>While Web architecture allows the definition of new schemes,
introducing a new scheme is costly. Many aspects of URI processing
are scheme-dependent, and a large amount of deployed software
already processes URIs of well-known schemes. Introducing a new URI
scheme requires the development and deployment not only of client
software to handle the scheme, but also of ancillary agents such as
gateways, proxies, and caches. See [[!RFC2718]] for other
considerations and costs related to URI scheme design.</p>
<p>Because of these costs, if a URI scheme exists that meets the
needs of an application, designers should use it rather than invent
one.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-reuse-uri-schemes">Reuse URI schemes</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A specification SHOULD reuse an existing URI
scheme (rather than create a new one) when it provides the desired
properties of identifiers and their relation to resources.</p>
</div>
<p>Consider our <a href="#scenario">travel scenario</a>: should the
agent providing information about the weather in Oaxaca register a
new URI scheme &quot;weather&quot; for the identification of resources
related to the weather? They might then publish URIs such as
&quot;weather://travel.example.com/oaxaca&quot;. When a software agent
dereferences such a URI, if what really happens is that HTTP GET is
invoked to retrieve a representation of the resource, then an
&quot;http&quot; URI would have sufficed.</p>
<div id="URI-registration" class="section">
<h4>URI Scheme Registration</h4>
<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (<abbr>IANA</abbr>)
maintains a registry [[!IANASchemes]] of mappings between URI
scheme names and scheme specifications. For instance, the IANA
registry indicates that the &quot;http&quot; scheme is defined in
[[!RFC2616]]. The process for registering a new URI scheme is
defined in [[!RFC2717]].</p>
<p>Unregistered URI schemes SHOULD NOT be used for a number of
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no generally accepted way to locate the scheme
specification.</li>
<li>Someone else may be using the scheme for other purposes.</li>
<li>One should not expect that general-purpose software will do
anything useful with URIs of this scheme beyond URI
comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>One misguided motivation for registering a new URI scheme is to
allow a software agent to launch a particular application when
retrieving a representation. The same thing can be accomplished at
lower expense by dispatching instead on the type of the
representation, thereby allowing use of existing transfer protocols
and implementations.</p>
<p>Even if an agent cannot process representation data in an
unknown format, it can at least retrieve it. The data may contain
enough information to allow a user or user agent to make some use
of it. When an agent does not handle a new URI scheme, it cannot
retrieve a representation.</p>
<p>When designing a new data format, the preferred mechanism to
promote its deployment on the Web is the Internet media type (see
<a href="#internet-media-type">Representation Types and Internet
Media Types</a>). Media types also provide a means for building new
information applications, as described in <a href="#media-types-infospace">future directions for data formats</a>
.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="uri-opacity" class="section">
<h3>URI Opacity</h3>
<p>It is tempting to guess the nature of a resource by inspection
of a URI that identifies it. However, the Web is designed so that
agents communicate resource information state through <a href="#def-representation">representations</a>, not identifiers. In
general, one cannot determine the type of a resource representation
by inspecting a URI for that resource. For example, the &quot;.html&quot; at
the end of &quot;http://example.com/page.html&quot; provides no guarantee
that representations of the identified resource will be served with
the Internet media type &quot;text/html&quot;. The publisher is free to
allocate identifiers and define how they are served. The HTTP
protocol does not constrain the Internet media type based on the
path component of the URI; the URI owner is free to configure the
server to return a representation using PNG or any other data
format.</p>
<p>Resource state may evolve over time. Requiring a URI owner to
publish a new URI for each change in resource state would lead to a
significant number of broken references. For robustness, Web
architecture promotes independence between an identifier and the
state of the identified resource.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-uri-opacity">URI opacity</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">Agents making use of URIs SHOULD NOT attempt to
infer properties of the referenced resource.</p>

<p>In practice, a small number of inferences can be made because
they are explicitly licensed by the relevant specifications. Some
of these inferences are discussed in the <a href="#dereference-details">details of retrieving a representation</a>
.</p>
<p>The example URI used in the <a href="#scenario">travel
scenario</a> (&quot;http://weather.example.com/oaxaca&quot;) suggests to a
human reader that the identified resource has something to do with
the weather in Oaxaca. A site reporting the weather in Oaxaca could
just as easily be identified by the URI
&quot;http://vjc.example.com/315&quot;. And the URI
&quot;http://weather.example.com/vancouver&quot; might identify the resource
&quot;my photo album.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the URI &quot;mailto:joe@example.com&quot; indicates
that the URI refers to a mailbox. The &quot;mailto&quot; URI scheme
specification authorizes agents to infer that URIs of this form
identify Internet mailboxes.</p>
<p>Some URI assignment authorities document and publish their URI
assignment policies. For more information about URI opacity, see

the representation that conveys information about the weekend
outlook. This URI includes the fragment identifier &quot;weekend&quot; (the
string after the &quot;#&quot;).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <dfn>fragment identifier</dfn> component of a URI allows
indirect identification of a <dfn>secondary resource</dfn> by
reference to a primary resource and additional identifying
information. The secondary resource may be some portion or subset
of the primary resource, some view on representations of the
primary resource, or some other resource defined or described by
those representations. The terms &quot;primary resource&quot; and &quot;secondary
resource&quot; are defined in section 3.5 of [[!URI]].</p>
<p>The terms “primary” and “secondary” in this context do not limit
the nature of the resource—they are not classes. In this context,
primary and secondary simply indicate that there is a relationship
between the resources for the purposes of one URI: the URI with a
fragment identifier. Any resource can be identified as a secondary
resource. It might also be identified using a URI without a
fragment identifier, and a resource may be identified as a
secondary resource via multiple URIs. The purpose of these terms is
to enable discussion of the relationship between such resources,
not to limit the nature of a resource.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>Communication between agents over a network about resources

messages. A <dfn>message</dfn> may include data as well as metadata
about a resource (such as the &quot;Alternates&quot; and &quot;Vary&quot; HTTP
headers), the message data, and the message itself (such as the
&quot;Transfer-encoding&quot; HTTP header). A message may even include

image&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Nadia's browser analyzes the URI and
determines that its <a href="#URI-scheme">scheme</a> is &quot;http&quot;. The
browser configuration determines how it locates the identified
information, which might be via a cache of prior retrieval actions,
by contacting an intermediary (such as a proxy server), or by
direct access to the server identified by a portion of the URI. In
this example, the browser opens a network connection to port 80 on
the server at &quot;example.com&quot; and sends a &quot;GET&quot; message as specified
by the HTTP protocol, requesting a representation of the
resource.</p>
<p>The server sends a response message to the browser, once again
according to the HTTP protocol. The message consists of several
headers and a JPEG image. The browser reads the headers, learns
from the &quot;Content-Type&quot; field that the Internet media type of the
representation is &quot;image/jpeg&quot;, reads the sequence of octets that
make up the representation data, and renders the image.</p>

interactions.</p>
<div id="dereference-uri" class="section">
<h3>Using a URI to Access a Resource</h3>
<p>Agents may use a URI to access the referenced resource; this is
called <dfn>dereferencing the URI</dfn>. Access may take many
forms, including retrieving a representation of the resource (for
instance, by using HTTP GET or HEAD), adding or modifying a
representation of the resource (for instance, by using HTTP POST or
PUT, which in some cases may change the actual state of the
resource if the submitted representations are interpreted as
instructions to that end), and deleting some or all representations
of the resource (for instance, by using HTTP DELETE, which in some
cases may result in the deletion of the resource itself).</p>
<p>There may be more than one way to access a resource for a given
URI; application context determines which access method an agent
uses. For instance, a browser might use HTTP GET to retrieve a
representation of a resource, whereas a hypertext link checker
might use HTTP HEAD on the same URI simply to establish whether a
representation is available. Some URI schemes set expectations
about available access methods, others (such as the URN scheme
[[!RFC2141]]) do not. Section 1.2.2 of [[!URI]] discusses the
separation of identification and interaction in more detail. For
more information about relationships between multiple access
methods and URI addressability, see the TAG finding <cite>&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html">URIs,
Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST</a>&quot;</cite>.</p>
<p>Although many <a href="#URI-scheme">URI schemes</a> are named
after protocols, this does not imply that use of such a URI will
necessarily result in access to the resource via the named
protocol. Even when an agent uses a URI to retrieve a
representation, that access might be through gateways, proxies,
caches, and name resolution services that are independent of the
protocol associated with the scheme name.</p>
<p>Many URI schemes define a default interaction protocol for
attempting access to the identified resource. That interaction
protocol is often the basis for allocating identifiers within that
scheme, just as &quot;http&quot; URIs are defined in terms of TCP-based HTTP
servers. However, this does not imply that all interaction with
such resources is limited to the default interaction protocol. For
example, information retrieval systems often make use of proxies to
interact with a multitude of URI schemes, such as HTTP proxies
being used to access &quot;ftp&quot; and &quot;wais&quot; resources. Proxies can also
to provide enhanced services, such as annotation proxies that
combine normal information retrieval with additional metadata
retrieval to provide a seamless, multidimensional view of resources
using the same protocols and user agents as the non-annotated Web.
Likewise, future protocols may be defined that encompass our
current systems, using entirely different interaction mechanisms,
without changing the existing identifier schemes. See also,
<a href="#orthogonal-specs">principle of orthogonal
specifications</a>.</p>
<div id="dereference-details" class="section">
<h4>Details of retrieving a representation</h4>
<p>Dereferencing a URI generally involves a succession of steps as
described in multiple specifications and implemented by the agent.
The following example illustrates the series of specifications that
governs the process when a user agent is instructed to follow a
<a href="#hypertext">hypertext link</a> that is part of an SVG
document. In this example, the URI is
&quot;http://weather.example.com/oaxaca&quot; and the application context
calls for the user agent to retrieve and render a representation of
the identified resource.</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the URI is part of a hypertext link in an SVG document,
the first relevant specification is the SVG 1.1 Recommendation
[<a href="#SVG11">SVG11</a>]. <a href="/TR/SVG11/linking.html#Links">Section 17.1</a> of this
specification imports the link semantics defined in XLink 1.0
[<a href="#XLink10">XLink10</a>]: &quot;The remote resource (the
destination for the link) is defined by a URI specified by the
XLink <code>href</code> attribute on the '<code>a</code>' element.&quot;
The SVG specification goes on to state that interpretation of an
<code>a</code> element involves retrieving a representation of a
resource, identified by the <code>href</code> attribute in the
XLink namespace: &quot;By activating these links (by clicking with the
mouse, through keyboard input, voice commands, etc.), users may
visit these resources.&quot;</li>
<li>The XLink 1.0 [<a href="#XLink10">XLink10</a>] specification,
which defines the <code>href</code> attribute in section 5.4,
states that &quot;The value of the href attribute must be a URI
reference as defined in [IETF RFC 2396], or must result in a URI
reference after the escaping procedure described below is
applied.&quot;</li>
<li>The URI specification [[!URI]] states that &quot;Each URI begins
with a scheme name that refers to a specification for assigning
identifiers within that scheme.&quot; The URI scheme name in this
example is &quot;http&quot;.</li>
<li>[[!IANASchemes]] states that the &quot;http&quot; scheme is defined by
the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616 [[!RFC2616]], section
3.2.2).</li>
<li>In this SVG context, the agent constructs an HTTP GET request
(per section 9.3 of [[!RFC2616]]) to retrieve the
representation.</li>
<li>Section 6 of [[!RFC2616]] defines how the server constructs a
corresponding response message, including the 'Content-Type'
field.</li>
<li>Section 1.4 of [[!RFC2616]] states &quot;HTTP communication usually
takes place over TCP/IP connections.&quot; This example addresses
neither that step in the process nor other steps such as Domain
Name System (<abbr>DNS</abbr>) resolution.</li>
<li>The agent interprets the returned representation according to
the data format specification that corresponds to the
representation's <a href="#internet-media-type">Internet Media
Type</a> (the value of the HTTP 'Content-Type') in the relevant
IANA registry [<a href="#MEDIATYPEREG">MEDIATYPEREG</a>].</li>
</ol>
<p>Precisely which representation(s) are retrieved depends on a
number of factors, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether the URI owner makes available any representations at
all;</li>
<li>Whether the agent making the request has access privileges for
those representations (see the section on <a href="#id-access">linking and access control</a>);</li>
<li>If the URI owner has provided more than one representation (in
different formats such as HTML, PNG, or RDF; in different languages
such as English and Spanish; or transformed dynamically according
to the hardware or software capabilities of the recipient), the
resulting representation may depend on negotiation between the user
agent and server.</li>
<li>The time of the request; the world changes over time, so
representations of resources are also likely to change over
time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that a representation has been successfully retrieved,
the expressive power of the representation's format will affect how
precisely the representation provider communicates resource state.
If the representation communicates the state of the resource
inaccurately, this inaccuracy or ambiguity may lead to confusion
among users about what the resource is. If different users reach
different conclusions about what the resource is, they may
interpret this as a <a href="#URI-collision">URI collision</a> .
Some communities, such as the ones developing the Semantic Web,
seek to provide a framework for accurately communicating the
semantics of a resource in a machine readable way. Machine readable
semantics may alleviate some of the ambiguity associated with
natural language descriptions of resources.</p>

<h3><a>Representation Types and Internet Media Types</a></h3>
<p>A <dfn>representation</dfn> is data that encodes information
about resource state. Representations do not necessarily describe
the resource, or portray a likeness of the resource, or represent
the resource in other senses of the word &quot;represent&quot;.</p>
<p>Representations of a resource may be sent or received using
interaction protocols. These protocols in turn determine the form
in which representations are conveyed on the Web. HTTP, for
example, provides for transmission of representations as octet
streams typed using Internet media types [<a href="#RFC2046">RFC2046</a>].</p>
<p>Just as it is important to reuse existing URI schemes whenever
possible, there are significant benefits to using media typed octet
streams for representations even in the unusual case where a new
URI scheme and associated protocol is to be defined. For example,
if the Oaxaca weather were conveyed to Nadia's browser using a
protocol other than HTTP, then software to render formats such as
text/xhmtl+xml and image/png would still be usable if the new
protocol supported transmission of those types. This is an example

<h4>Representation types and fragment identifier semantics</h4>
<p>The Internet Media Type defines the syntax and semantics of the
fragment identifier (introduced in <a href="#fragid">Fragment
Identifiers</a>), if any, that may be used in conjunction with a
representation.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="storylab">Story</span></p>
<div class="story">
<p>In one of his XHTML pages, Dirk creates a hypertext link to an
image that Nadia has published on the Web. He creates a hypertext
link with <code>&lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.example.com/images/nadia#hat&quot;&gt;Nadia's
hat&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Emma views Dirk's XHTML page in her Web
browser and follows the link. The HTML implementation in her
browser removes the fragment from the URI and requests the image
&quot;http://www.example.com/images/nadia&quot;. Nadia serves an SVG
representation of the image (with Internet media type
&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;). Emma's Web browser starts up an SVG
implementation to view the image. It passes it the original URI
including the fragment, &quot;http://www.example.com/images/nadia#hat&quot;
to this implementation, causing a view of the hat to be displayed
rather than the complete image.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that the HTML implementation in Emma's browser did not need
to <em>understand the syntax or semantics</em> of the SVG fragment
(nor does the SVG implementation have to understand HTML, WebCGM,
RDF ... fragment syntax or semantics; it merely had to recognize
the # delimiter from the URI syntax [URI] and remove the fragment
when accessing the resource). This <a href="#orthogonal-specs">orthogonality</a> is an important feature of
Web architecture; it is what enabled Emma's browser to provide a
useful service without requiring an upgrade.</p>
<p>The semantics of a fragment identifier are defined by the set of
representations that might result from a retrieval action on the
primary resource. The fragment's format and resolution are
therefore dependent on the type of a potentially retrieved
representation, even though such a retrieval is only performed if
the URI is dereferenced. If no such representation exists, then the
semantics of the fragment are considered unknown and, effectively,
unconstrained. Fragment identifier semantics are orthogonal to URI
schemes and thus cannot be redefined by URI scheme
specifications.</p>
<p>Interpretation of the fragment identifier is performed solely by
the agent that dereferences a URI; the fragment identifier is not
passed to other systems during the process of retrieval. This means
that some intermediaries in Web architecture (such as proxies) have
no interaction with fragment identifiers and that redirection (in
HTTP [[!RFC2616]], for example) does not account for fragments.</p>
</div>
<div id="frag-coneg" class="section">
<h4>Fragment identifiers and content negotiation</h4>
<p><dfn>Content negotiation</dfn> refers to the practice of making
available multiple representations via the same URI. Negotiation
between the requesting agent and the server determines which
representation is served (usually with the goal of serving the
&quot;best&quot; representation a receiving agent can process). HTTP is an
example of a protocol that enables representation providers to use
content negotiation.</p>
<p>Individual data formats may define their own rules for use of
the fragment identifier syntax for specifying different types of
subsets, views, or external references that are identifiable as
secondary resources by that media type. Therefore, representation
providers must manage content negotiation carefully when used with
a URI that contains a fragment identifier. Consider an example
where the owner of the URI
&quot;http://weather.example.com/oaxaca/map#zicatela&quot; uses content
negotiation to serve two representations of the identified
resource. Three situations can arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The interpretation of &quot;zicatela&quot; is defined consistently by
both data format specifications. The representation provider
decides when definitions of fragment identifier semantics are are
sufficiently consistent.</li>
<li>The interpretation of &quot;zicatela&quot; is defined inconsistently by
the data format specifications.</li>
<li>The interpretation of &quot;zicatela&quot; is defined in one data format
specification but not the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first situation—consistent semantics—poses no problem.</p>
<p>The second case is a server management error: representation
providers must not use content negotiation to serve representation
formats that have inconsistent fragment identifier semantics. This
situation also leads to <a href="#URI-collision">URI collision</a>
.</p>
<p>The third case is not a server management error. It is a means
by which the Web can grow. Because the Web is a distributed system
in which formats and agents are deployed in a non-uniform manner,
Web architecture does not constrain authors to only use &quot;lowest
common denominator&quot; formats. Content authors may take advantage of
new data formats while still ensuring reasonable
backward-compatibility for agents that do not yet implement
them.</p>
<p>In case three, behavior by the receiving agent should vary
depending on whether the negotiated format defines fragment
identifier semantics. When a received data format does not define
fragment identifier semantics, the agent should not perform
<a href="#no-silent-recovery">silent error recovery</a> unless the
user has given consent; see [[!CUAP]] for additional suggested
agent behavior in this case.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="metadata-inconsistencies">Inconsistencies between
Representation Data and Metadata</h3>
<p>Successful communication between two parties depends on a
reasonably shared understanding of the semantics of exchanged
messages, both data and metadata. At times, there may be
inconsistencies between a message sender's data and metadata.
Examples, observed in practice, of inconsistencies between
representation data and metadata include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual character encoding of a representation (e.g.,
&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;, specified by the <code>encoding</code> attribute in
an XML declaration) is inconsistent with the charset parameter in
the representation metadata (e.g., &quot;utf-8&quot;, specified by the
'Content-Type' field in an HTTP header).</li>
<li>The <a href="#xml-namespaces">namespace</a> of the root element
of XML representation data (e.g., as specified by the &quot;xmlns&quot;
attribute) is inconsistent with the value of the 'Content-Type'
field in an HTTP header.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, there is no inconsistency in serving HTML
content with the media type &quot;text/plain&quot;, for example, as this
combination is licensed by specifications.</p>
<p>Receiving agents should detect protocol inconsistencies and
perform proper <a href="#def-error-recovery">error
recovery</a>.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="constraintlab">Constraint: <a id="pr-server-auth">Data-metadata inconsistency</a></span></p>
<p class="constraint">Agents MUST NOT ignore message metadata
without the consent of the user.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, for example, if the parties responsible for
&quot;weather.example.com&quot; mistakenly label the satellite photo of
Oaxaca as &quot;image/gif&quot; instead of &quot;image/jpeg&quot;, and if Nadia's
browser detects a problem, Nadia's browser must not ignore the
problem (e.g., by simply rendering the JPEG image) without Nadia's
consent. Nadia's browser can notify Nadia of the problem or notify
Nadia and take corrective action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, representation providers can help reduce the risk
of inconsistencies through careful assignment of representation
metadata (especially that which applies across representations).
The section on <a href="#xml-media-types">media types for XML</a>
presents an example of reducing the risk of error by providing no
metadata about character encoding when serving XML.</p>
<p>The accuracy of metadata relies on the server administrators,
the authors of representations, and the software that they use.
Practically, the capabilities of the tools and the social
relationships may be the limiting factors.</p>
<p>The accuracy of these and other metadata fields is just as
important for dynamic Web resources, where a little bit of thought
and programming can often ensure correct metadata for a huge number
of resources.</p>
<p>Often there is a separation of control between the users who
create representations of resources and the server managers who
maintain the Web site software. Given that it is generally the Web
site software that provides the metadata associated with a
resource, it follows that coordination between the server managers
and content creators is required.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-metadata-association">Metadata association</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">Server managers SHOULD allow representation
creators to control the metadata associated with their

</div>
<p>In particular, content creators need to be able to control the

<div id="safe-interaction" class="section">
<h3>Safe Interactions</h3>
<p>Nadia's retrieval of weather information (an example of a
read-only query or lookup) qualifies as a &quot;safe&quot; interaction; a
<dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the agent does not incur
any obligation beyond the interaction. An agent may incur an
obligation through other means (such as by signing a contract). If
an agent does not have an obligation before a safe interaction, it
does not have that obligation afterwards.</p>
<p>Other Web interactions resemble orders more than queries. These
<dfn>unsafe interactions</dfn> may cause a change to the state of a
resource and the user may be held responsible for the consequences
of these interactions. Unsafe interactions include subscribing to a
newsletter, posting to a list, or modifying a database.
<strong>Note:</strong> In this context, the word &quot;unsafe&quot; does not
necessarily mean &quot;dangerous&quot;; the term &quot;safe&quot; is used in section
9.1.1 of [[!RFC2616]] and &quot;unsafe&quot; is the natural opposite.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="storylab">Story</span></p>
<div class="story">
<p>Nadia decides to book a vacation to Oaxaca at
&quot;booking.example.com.&quot; She enters data into a series of online
forms and is ultimately asked for credit card information to
purchase the airline tickets. She provides this information in
another form. When she presses the &quot;Purchase&quot; button, her browser
opens another network connection to the server at
&quot;booking.example.com&quot; and sends a message composed of form data
using the POST method. This is an <a href="#def-unsafe-interaction">unsafe interaction</a>; Nadia wishes to
change the state of the system by exchanging money for airline
tickets.</p>
<p>The server reads the POST request, and after performing the
booking transaction returns a message to Nadia's browser that
contains a representation of the results of Nadia's request. The
representation data is in XHTML so that it can be saved or printed
out for Nadia's records.</p>
<p>Note that neither the data transmitted with the POST nor the
data received in the response necessarily correspond to any
resource identified by a URI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Safe interactions are important because these are interactions
where users can browse with confidence and where agents (including
search engines and browsers that pre-cache data for the user) can
follow hypertext links safely. Users (or agents acting on their
behalf) do not commit themselves to anything by querying a resource
or following a hypertext link.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="principlelab">Principle: <a id="pr-deref-safe">Safe
retrieval</a></span></p>
<p class="principle">Agents do not incur obligations by retrieving
a representation.</p>
</div>
<p>For instance, it is incorrect to publish a URI that, when
followed as part of a hypertext link, subscribes a user to a
mailing list. Remember that search engines may follow such
hypertext links.</p>
<p>The fact that HTTP GET, the access method most often used when
following a hypertext link, is safe does not imply that all safe
interactions must be done through HTTP GET. At times, there may be
good reasons (such as confidentiality requirements or practical
limits on URI length) to conduct an otherwise safe operation using
a mechanism generally reserved for unsafe operations (e.g., HTTP
POST).</p>
<p>For more information about safe and unsafe operations using HTTP
GET and POST, and handling security concerns around the use of HTTP
GET, see the TAG finding <cite>&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html">URIs,

<p>There are ways to provide persistent URIs for transaction
requests and their results. For transaction requests, user agents
can provide an interface for managing transactions where the user
agent has incurred an obligation on behalf of the user. For
transaction results, HTTP allows representation providers to
associate a URI with the results of an HTTP POST request using the
&quot;Content-Location&quot; header (described in section 14.14 of

review to her friend Dirk recommending that he check out
'http://weather.example.com/oaxaca'. Dirk clicks on the resulting
hypertext link in the email he receives and is frustrated by a 404

representation with &quot;news&quot; that is two-weeks old. He tries one more
time the next day only to receive a representation that claims that
the weather in Oaxaca is sunny, even though his friends in Oaxaca
tell him by phone that in fact it is raining. Dirk and Nadia
conclude that the URI owners are unreliable or unpredictable.
Although the URI owner has chosen the Web as a communication
medium, the owner has lost two customers due to ineffective
representation management.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A URI owner may supply zero or more authoritative

persistence</a>, managing <a href="#id-access">access to

<div id="URI-persistence" class="section">
<h4>URI persistence</h4>
<p>As is the case with many human interactions, confidence in
interactions via the Web depends on stability and predictability.
For an information resource, persistence depends on the consistency
of representations. The representation provider decides when
representations are sufficiently consistent (although that
determination generally takes user expectations into account).</p>
<p>Although persistence in this case is observable as a result of
representation retrieval, the term <dfn>URI persistence</dfn> is
used to describe the desirable property that, once associated with
a resource, a URI should continue indefinitely to refer to that
resource.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-service-uri">Consistent representation</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A URI owner SHOULD provide representations of
the identified resource consistently and predictably.</p>
</div>
<p>URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part
of the <a href="#uri-ownership">URI owner</a>. The choice of a
particular URI scheme provides no guarantee that those URIs will be
persistent or that they will not be persistent.</p>
<p>HTTP [[!RFC2616]] has been designed to help manage URI
persistence. For example, HTTP redirection (using the 3xx response
codes) permits servers to tell an agent that further action needs
to be taken by the agent in order to fulfill the request (for
example, a new URI is associated with the resource).</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="#def-coneg">content negotiation</a> also
promotes consistency, as a site manager is not required to define
new URIs when adding support for a new format specification.
Protocols that do not support content negotiation (such as FTP)
require a new identifier when a new data format is introduced.
Improper use of content negotiation can lead to inconsistent
representations.</p>

</div>
<div id="id-access" class="section">
<h4>Linking and access control</h4>
<p>It is reasonable to limit access to a resource (for commercial
or security reasons, for example), but merely identifying the
resource is like referring to a book by title. In exceptional
circumstances, people may have agreed to keep titles or URIs
confidential (for example, a book author and a publisher may agree
to keep the URI of page containing additional material secret until
after the book is published), otherwise they are free to exchange
them.</p>
<p>As an analogy: The owners of a building might have a policy that
the public may only enter the building via the main front door, and
only during business hours. People who work in the building and who
make deliveries to it might use other doors as appropriate. Such a
policy would be enforced by a combination of security personnel and
mechanical devices such as locks and pass-cards. One would not
enforce this policy by hiding some of the building entrances, nor
by requesting legislation requiring the use of the front door and
forbidding anyone to reveal the fact that there are other doors to
the building.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">

<div class="story">
<p>Nadia sends to Dirk the URI of the current article she is
reading. With his browser, Dirk follows the hypertext link and is
asked to enter his subscriber username and password. Since Dirk is
also a subscriber to services provided by &quot;weather.example.com,&quot; he
can access the same information as Nadia. Thus, the authority for
&quot;weather.example.com&quot; can limit access to authorized parties and
still provide the benefits of URIs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Web provides several mechanisms to control access to
resources; these mechanisms do not rely on hiding or suppressing
URIs for those resources. For more information, see the TAG finding

<div id="supporting-navigation" class="section">
<h4>Supporting Navigation</h4>
<p>It is a strength of Web Architecture that links can be made and
shared; a user who has found an interesting part of the Web can
share this experience just by republishing a URI.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="storylab">Story</span></p>
<div class="story">
<p>Nadia and Dirk want to visit the Museum of Weather Forecasting
in Oaxaca. Nadia goes to &quot;http://maps.example.com&quot;, locates the

Dirk. Dirk goes to &quot;http://mymaps.example.com&quot;, locates the museum,
and mails the URI
&quot;http://mymaps.example.com/geo?sessionID=765345;userID=Dirk&quot; to
Nadia. Dirk reads Nadia's email and is able to follow the link to
the map. Nadia reads Dirk's email, follows the link, and receives
an error message 'No such session/user'. Nadia has to start again
from &quot;http://mymaps.example.com&quot; and find the museum location once
more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For resources that are generated on demand, machine generation
of URIs is common. For resources that might usefully be bookmarked
for later perusal, or shared with others, server managers should
avoid needlessly restricting the reusability of such URIs. If the
intention is to restrict information to a particular user, as might
be the case in a home banking application for example, designers
should use appropriate <a href="#id-access">access control</a>
mechanisms.</p>
<p>Interactions conducted with HTTP POST (where HTTP GET could have
been used) also limit navigation possibilities. The user cannot
create a bookmark or share the URI because HTTP POST transactions
do not typically result in a different URI as the user interacts
with the site.</p>

<h3>Future Directions for Interaction</h3>
<p>There remain open questions regarding Web interactions. The TAG
expects future versions of this document to address in more detail
the relationship between the architecture described herein,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/">Web Services</a>, peer-to-peer
systems, instant messaging systems (such as [[!RFC3920]]),
streaming audio (such as RTSP [[!RFC2326]]), and voice-over-IP
(such as SIP [[!RFC3261]]).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="formats" class="section">
<h2>Data Formats</h2>
<p>A data format specification (for example, for XHTML, RDF/XML,
SMIL, XLink, CSS, and PNG) embodies an agreement on the correct
interpretation of <a href="#def-representation">representation</a>
data. The first data format used on the Web was HTML. Since then,
data formats have grown in number. Web architecture does not
constrain which data formats content providers can use. This
flexibility is important because there is constant evolution in
applications, resulting in new data formats and refinements of
existing formats. Although Web architecture allows for the
deployment of new data formats, the creation and deployment of new
formats (and agents able to handle them) is expensive. Thus, before
inventing a new data format (or &quot;meta&quot; format such as XML),
designers should carefully consider re-using one that is already
available.</p>
<p>For a data format to be usefully interoperable between two
parties, the parties must agree (to a reasonable extent) about its
syntax and semantics. Shared understanding of a data format
promotes interoperability but does not imply constraints on usage;
for instance, a sender of data cannot count on being able to
constrain the behavior of a data receiver.</p>
<p>Below we describe some characteristics of a data format that
facilitate integration into Web architecture. This document does
not address generally beneficial characteristics of a specification
such as readability, simplicity, attention to programmer goals,
attention to user needs, accessibility, nor internationalization.
The section on <a href="#archspecs">architectural
specifications</a> includes references to additional format
specification guidelines.</p>
<div id="binary" class="section">
<h3>Binary and Textual Data Formats</h3>
<p>Binary data formats are those in which portions of the data are
encoded for direct use by computer processors, for example 32 bit
little-endian two's-complement and 64 bit IEEE double-precision
floating-point. The portions of data so represented include numeric
values, pointers, and compressed data of all sorts.</p>
<p>A textual data format is one in which the data is specified in a
defined encoding as a sequence of characters. HTML, Internet
e-mail, and all <a href="#xml-formats">XML-based formats</a> are
textual. Increasingly, internationalized textual data formats refer
to the Unicode repertoire [[!UNICODE]] for character
definitions.</p>
<p>If a data format is textual, as defined in this section, that
does not imply that it should be served with a media type beginning
with &quot;text/&quot;. Although XML-based formats are textual, many
XML-based formats do not consist primarily of phrases in natural
language. See the section on <a href="#xml-media-types">media types
for XML</a> for issues that arise when &quot;text/&quot; is used in
conjunction with an XML-based format.</p>
<p>In principle, all data can be represented using textual formats.
In practice, some types of content (e.g., audio and video) are
generally represented using binary formats.</p>
<p>The trade-offs between binary and textual data formats are
complex and application-dependent. Binary formats can be
substantially more compact, particularly for complex pointer-rich
data structures. Also, they can be consumed more rapidly by agents
in those cases where they can be loaded into memory and used with
little or no conversion. Note, however, that such cases are
relatively uncommon as such direct use may open the door to
security issues that can only practically be addressed by examining
every aspect of the data structure in detail.</p>
<p>Textual formats are usually more portable and interoperable.
Textual formats also have the considerable advantage that they can
be directly read by human beings (and understood, given sufficient
documentation). This can simplify the tasks of creating and
maintaining software, and allow the direct intervention of humans
in the processing chain without recourse to tools more complex than
the ubiquitous text editor. Finally, it simplifies the necessary
human task of learning about new data formats; this is called the
&quot;view source&quot; effect.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that intuition as to such matters
as data size and processing speed is not a reliable guide in data
format design; quantitative studies are essential to a correct
understanding of the trade-offs. Therefore, designers of a data
format specification should make a considered choice between binary
and textual format design.</p>

<div id="ext-version" class="section">
<h3>Versioning and Extensibility</h3>
<p>In a perfect world, language designers would invent languages
that perfectly met the requirements presented to them, the
requirements would be a perfect model of the world, they would
never change over time, and all implementations would be perfectly
interoperable because the specifications would have no
variability.</p>
<p>In the real world, language designers imperfectly address the
requirements as they interpret them, the requirements inaccurately
model the world, conflicting requirements are presented, and they
change over time. As a result, designers negotiate with users, make
compromises, and often introduce extensibility mechanisms so that
it is possible to work around problems in the short term. In the
long term, they produce multiple versions of their languages, as
the problem, and their understanding of it, evolve. The resulting
variability in specifications, languages, and implementations
introduces interoperability costs.</p>
<p>Extensibility and versioning are strategies to help manage the
natural evolution of information on the Web and technologies used
to represent that information. For more information about how these
strategies introduce variability and how that variability impacts
interoperability, see <a href="#SPECVAR">Variability in
Specifications</a>.</p>

<p>Nadia and Dirk are designing an XML data format to encode data

attribute on the <code>film</code> element. Dirk feels that such a
change requires them to assign a new namespace name, which might
require changes to deployed software. Nadia explains to Dirk that
their choice of extensibility strategy in conjunction with their
namespace policy allows certain changes that do not affect
conformance of existing content and software, and thus no change to
the namespace identifier is required. They chose this policy to
help them meet their goals of reducing the cost of change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dirk and Nadia have chosen a particular namespace change policy
that allows them to avoid changing the namespace name whenever they
make changes that do not affect conformance of deployed content and
software. They might have chosen a different policy, for example
that any new element or attribute has to belong to a namespace
other than the original one. Whatever the chosen policy, it should
set clear expectations for users of the format.</p>
<p>In general, changing the namespace name of an element completely
changes the element name. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are bound to two different
URIs, <code>a:element</code> and <code>b:element</code> are as
distinct as <code>a:eieio</code> and <code>a:xyzzy</code>.
Practically speaking, this means that deployed applications will
have to be upgraded in order to recognize the new language; the
cost of this upgrade may be very high.</p>
<p>It follows that there are significant tradeoffs to be considered
when deciding on a namespace change policy. If a vocabulary has no
extensibility points (that is, if it does not allow elements or
attributes from foreign namespaces or have a mechanism for dealing
with unrecognized names from the same namespace), it may be
absolutely necessary to change the namespace name. Languages that
allow some form of extensibility without requiring a change to the
namespace name are more likely to evolve gracefully.</p>

<p class="practice">An XML format specification SHOULD include

</div>
<p>As an example of a change policy designed to reflect the
variable stability of a namespace, consider the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/nsuri">W3C namespace policy</a> for
documents on the W3C Recommendation track. The policy sets
expectations that the Working Group responsible for the namespace
may modify it in any way until a certain point in the process
(&quot;Candidate Recommendation&quot;) at which point W3C constrains the set
of possible changes to the namespace in order to promote stable
implementations.</p>
<p>Note that since namespace names are URIs, the owner of a
namespace URI has the authority to decide the namespace change
policy.</p>

<div id="extensibility" class="section">
<h4>Extensibility</h4>
<p>Requirements change over time. Successful technologies are
adopted and adapted by new users. Designers can facilitate the
transition process by making careful choices about extensibility
during the design of a language or protocol specification.</p>
<p>In making these choices, the designers must weigh the trade-offs
between extensibility, simplicity, and variability. A language
without extensibility mechanisms may be simpler and less variable,
improving initial interoperability. However, it's likely that
changes to that language will be more difficult, possibly more
complex and more variable, than if the initial design had provided
such mechanisms. This may decrease interoperability over the long
term.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-allow-exts">Extensibility mechanisms</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A specification SHOULD provide mechanisms that
allow any party to create extensions.</p>
</div>
<p>Extensibility introduces variability which has an impact on
interoperability. However, languages that have no extensibility
mechanisms may be extended in ad hoc ways that impact
interoperability as well. One key criterion of the mechanisms
provided by language designers is that they allow the extended
languages to remain in conformance with the original specification,
increasing the likelihood of interoperability.</p>

</div>
<p>Application needs determine the most appropriate extension
strategy for a specification. For example, applications designed to
operate in closed environments may allow specification designers to
define a versioning strategy that would be impractical at the scale
of the Web.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="pr-unknown-extension">Unknown extensions</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A specification SHOULD specify agent behavior
in the face of unrecognized extensions.</p>
</div>
<p>Two strategies have emerged as being particularly useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Must ignore&quot;: The agent ignores any content it does not
recognize.</li>
<li>&quot;Must understand&quot;: The agent treats unrecognized markup as an
error condition.</li>
</ol>
<p>A powerful design approach is for the language to allow either
form of extension, but to distinguish explicitly between them in
the syntax.</p>
<p>Additional strategies include prompting the user for more input
and automatically retrieving data from available hypertext links.
More complex strategies are also possible, including mixing
strategies. For instance, a language can include mechanisms for
overriding standard behavior. Thus, a data format can specify &quot;must
ignore&quot; semantics but also allow for extensions that override that
semantics in light of application needs (for instance, with &quot;must
understand&quot; semantics for a particular extension).</p>
<p>Extensibility is not free. Providing hooks for extensibility is
one of many requirements to be factored into the costs of language
design. Experience suggests that the long term benefits of a
well-designed extensibility mechanism generally outweigh the
costs.</p>

<div id="composition" class="section">
<h4>Composition of data formats</h4>
<p>Many modern data format include mechanisms for composition. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to embed text comments in some image formats,
such as JPEG/JFIF. Although these comments are embedded in the
containing data, they are not intended to affect the display of the
image.</li>
<li>There are container formats such as SOAP which fully expect
content from multiple namespaces but which provide an overall
semantic relationship of message envelope and payload.</li>
<li>The semantics of combining RDF documents containing multiple
vocabularies are well-defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>In principle, these relationships can be mixed and nested
arbitrarily. A SOAP message, for example, can contain an SVG image
that contains an RDF comment which refers to a vocabulary of terms
for describing the image.</p>
<p>Note however, that for general XML there is no semantic model
that defines the interactions within XML documents with elements
and/or attributes from a variety of namespaces. Each application
must define how namespaces interact and what effect the namespace
of an element has on the element's ancestors, siblings, and
descendants.</p>

<h3>Separation of Content, Presentation, and Interaction</h3>
<p>The Web is a heterogeneous environment where a wide variety of
agents provide access to content to users with a wide variety of
capabilities. It is good practice for authors to create content
that can reach the widest possible audience, including users with
graphical desktop computers, hand-held devices and mobile phones,
users with disabilities who may require speech synthesizers, and
devices not yet imagined. Furthermore, authors cannot predict in
some cases how an agent will display or process their content.
Experience shows that the separation of content, presentation, and
interaction promotes the reuse and device-independence of content;
this follows from the <a href="#orthogonal-specs">principle of
orthogonal specifications</a>.</p>
<p>This separation also facilitates reuse of authored source
content across multiple delivery contexts. Sometimes, functional
user experiences suited to any delivery context can be generated by
using an adaptation process applied to a representation that does
not depend on the access mechanism. For more information about
principles of device-independence, see [<a href="#DIPRINCIPLES">DIPRINCIPLES</a>].</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="cpi">Separation
of content, presentation, interaction</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A specification SHOULD allow authors to
separate content from both presentation and interaction
concerns.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that when content, presentation, and interaction are
separated by design, agents need to recombine them. There is a
recombination spectrum, with &quot;client does all&quot; at one end and
&quot;server does all&quot; at the other.</p>
<p>There are advantages to each approach. For instance when a
client (such as a mobile phone) communicates device capabilities to
the server (for example, using CC/PP), the server can tailor the
delivered content to fit that client. The server can, for example,
enable faster downloads by adjusting links to refer to lower
resolution images, smaller video or no video at all. Similarly, if
the content has been authored with multiple branches, the server
can remove unused branches before delivery. In addition, by
tailoring the content to match the characteristics of a target
client, the server can help reduce client side computation.
However, specializing content in this manner reduces caching
efficiency.</p>
<p>On the other hand, designing content that that can be recombined
on the client also tends to make that content applicable to a wider
range of devices. This design also improves caching efficiency and
offers users more presentation options. Media-dependent style
sheets can be used to tailor the content on the client side to
particular groups of target devices. For textual content with a
regular and repeating structure, the combined size of the text
content plus the style sheet is typically less than that of fully
recombined content; the savings improve further if the style sheet
is reused by other pages.</p>
<p>In practice a combination of both approaches is often used. The
design decision about where on this spectrum an application should
be placed depends on the power on the client, the power and the
load on the server, and the bandwidth of the medium that connects
them. If the number of possible clients is unbounded, the
application will scale better if more computation is pushed to the
client.</p>
<p>Of course, it may not be desirable to reach the widest possible
audience. Designers should consider appropriate technologies, such
as encryption and <a href="#id-access">access control</a>, for
limiting the audience.</p>
<p>Some data formats are designed to describe presentation
(including SVG and XSL Formatting Objects). Data formats such as
these demonstrate that one can only separate content from
presentation (or interaction) so far; at some point it becomes
necessary to talk about presentation. Per the principle of <a href="#orthogonal-specs">orthogonal specifications</a> these data
formats should <em>only</em> address presentation issues.</p>

<h3>Hypertext</h3>
<p>A defining characteristic of the Web is that it allows embedded
references to other resources via URIs. The simplicity of creating
hypertext links using absolute URIs (<code>&lt;a

references (<code>&lt;a href=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a

responsible for the success of the hypertext Web as we know it
today.</p>
<p>When one resource (representation) refers to another resource
with a URI, this constitutes a <dfn>link</dfn> between the two
resources. Additional metadata may also form part of the link (see

<h4>URI references</h4>
<p>Links are commonly expressed using <dfn>URI references</dfn>
(defined in section 4.2 of [[!URI]]), which may be combined with a
base URI to yield a usable URI. Section 5.1 of [[!URI]] explains
different ways to establish a base URI for a resource and
establishes a precedence among them. For instance, the base URI may
be a URI for the resource, or specified in a representation (see
the <code>base</code> elements provided by HTML and XML, and the
HTTP 'Content-Location' header). See also the section on <a href="#xml-links" class="addrefnb">links in XML</a>.</p>
<p>Agents resolve a URI reference before using the resulting URI to

issues that are specific to such formats. Anyone seeking guidance

<h4>When to use an XML-based format</h4>
<p>XML defines textual data formats that are naturally suited to
describing data objects which are hierarchical and processed in a
chosen sequence. It is widely, but not universally, applicable for
data formats; an audio or video format, for example, is unlikely to
be well suited to expression in XML. Design constraints that would
suggest the use of XML include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requirement for a hierarchical structure.</li>
<li>Need for a wide range of tools on a variety of platforms.</li>
<li>Need for data that can outlive the applications that currently
process it.</li>
<li>Ability to support internationalization in a self-describing
way that makes confusion over coding options unlikely.</li>
<li>Early detection of encoding errors with no requirement to &quot;work
around&quot; such errors.</li>
<li>A high proportion of human-readable textual content.</li>
<li>Potential composition of the data format with other XML-encoded
formats.</li>
<li>Desire for data easily parsed by both humans and machines.</li>
<li>Desire for vocabularies that can be invented in a distributed
manner and combined flexibly.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="xml-links" class="section">
<h4>Links in XML</h4>
<p>Sophisticated linking mechanisms have been invented for XML
formats. XPointer allows links to address content that does not
have an explicit, named anchor. [[!XLink]] is an appropriate
specification for representing links in <a href="#hypertext">hypertext</a> XML applications. XLink allows links to
have multiple ends and to be expressed either inline or in &quot;link
bases&quot; stored external to any or all of the resources identified by
the links it contains.</p>
<p>Designers of XML-based formats may consider using XLink and, for
defining fragment identifier syntax, using the XPointer framework
and XPointer element() Schemes.</p>
<p>XLink is not the only linking design that has been proposed for
XML, nor is it universally accepted as a good design. See also TAG
issue <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#xlinkScope-23">xlinkScope-23</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="xml-namespaces" class="section">
<h4>XML namespaces</h4>
<p>The purpose of an XML namespace (defined in [<a href="#XMLNS">XMLNS</a>]) is to allow the deployment of XML vocabularies
(in which element and attribute names are defined) in a global
environment and to reduce the risk of name collisions in a given
document when vocabularies are combined. For example, the MathML
and SVG specifications both define the <code>set</code> element.
Although XML data from different formats such as MathML and SVG can
be combined in a single document, in this case there could be
ambiguity about which <code>set</code> element was intended. XML
namespaces reduce the risk of name collisions by taking advantage
of existing systems for allocating globally scoped names: the URI
system (see also the section on <a href="#uri-assignment" class="addrefnb">URI allocation</a>). When using XML namespaces,
each local name in an XML vocabulary is paired with a URI (called
the namespace URI) to distinguish the local name from local names
in other vocabularies.</p>
<p>The use of URIs confers additional benefits. First, each
URI/local name pair can be mapped to another URI, grounding the
terms of the vocabulary in the Web. These terms may be important
resources and thus it is appropriate to be able to associate URIs
with them.</p>
<p>For flat namespaces, concatenation is one useful mapping. If
namespace URIs that end with a hash (“#”) are chosen, then simple
concatenation of the namespace URI and the local name creates a URI
for a secondary resource (the identified term). This technique is
used for many [[!RDFXML]] namespaces.</p>
<p>Other mappings are likely to be more suitable for hierarchical
namespaces; see the related TAG issue <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#abstractComponentRefs-37">abstractComponentRefs-37</a>.</p>
<p>Designers of XML-based data formats who declare namespaces thus
make it possible to reuse those data formats and combine them in
novel ways not yet imagined. Failure to declare namespaces makes
such reuse more difficult, even impractical in some cases.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="use-namespaces">Namespace adoption</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">A specification that establishes an XML
vocabulary SHOULD place all element names and global attribute
names in a namespace.</p>
</div>
<p>Attributes are always scoped by the element on which they
appear. An attribute that is &quot;global,&quot; that is, one that might
meaningfully appear on elements of many types, including elements
in other namespaces, should be explicitly placed in a namespace.
Local attributes, ones associated with only a particular element
type, need not be included in a namespace since their meaning will
always be clear from the context provided by that element.</p>
<p>The <code>type</code> attribute from the W3C XML Schema Instance
namespace &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; ([<a href="#XMLSCHEMA">XMLSCHEMA</a>], section 4.3.2) is an example of a
global attribute. It can be used by authors of any vocabulary to
make an assertion in instance data about the type of the element on
which it appears. As a global attribute, it must always be
qualified. The <code>frame</code> attribute on an HTML table is an
example of a local attribute. There is no value in placing that
attribute in a namespace since the attribute is unlikely to be
useful on an element other than an HTML table.</p>
<p>Applications that rely on DTD processing must impose additional
constraints on the use of namespaces. DTDs perform validation based
on the lexical form of the element and attribute names in the
document. This makes prefixes syntactically significant in ways
that are not anticipated by [[!XMLNS]].</p>

<p>Nadia receives representation data from &quot;weather.example.com&quot; in
an unfamiliar data format. She knows enough about XML to recognize
which XML namespace the elements belong to. Since the namespace is
identified by the URI &quot;http://weather.example.com/2003/format&quot;, she
asks her browser to retrieve a representation of the identified
resource. She gets back some useful data that allows her to learn
more about the data format. Nadia's browser may also be able to
perform some operations automatically (i.e., unattended by a human
overseer) given data that has been optimized for software agents.
For example, her browser might, on Nadia's behalf, download
additional agents to process and render the format.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another benefit of using URIs to build XML namespaces is that
the namespace URI can be used to identify an information resource
that contains useful information, machine-usable and/or
human-usable, about terms in the namespace. This type of
information resource is called a <dfn>namespace document</dfn>.
When a namespace URI owner provides a namespace document, it is
authoritative for the namespace.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to provide a namespace document. A person
might want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the purpose of the namespace,</li>
<li>learn how to use the markup vocabulary in the namespace,</li>
<li>find out who controls it and associated policies,</li>
<li>request authority to access schemas or collateral material

<li>report a bug or situation that could be considered an error in

<p>A processor might want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>retrieve a schema, for validation,</li>
<li>retrieve a style sheet, for presentation, or</li>
<li>retrieve ontologies, for making inferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, there is no established best practice for creating
representations of a namespace document; application expectations

<h4>QNames in XML</h4>
<p>Section 3 of &quot;Namespaces in XML&quot; [<a href="#XMLNS">XMLNS</a>]
provides a syntactic construct known as a QName for the compact
expression of qualified names in XML documents. A qualified name is
a pair consisting of a URI, which names a namespace, and a local
name placed within that namespace. &quot;Namespaces in XML&quot; provides for
the use of QNames as names for XML elements and attributes.</p>
<p>Other specifications, starting with [<a href="#XSLT10">XSLT10</a>], have employed the idea of using QNames in
contexts other than element and attribute names, for example in
attribute values and in element content. However, general XML
processors cannot reliably recognize QNames as such when they are
used in attribute values and in element content; for example, the
syntax of QNames overlaps with that of URIs. Experience has also
revealed other limitations to QNames, such as losing namespace
bindings after XML canonicalization.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">

adopted the same syntax as a means of identifying resources. Though
convenient as a shorthand notation, this usage has a cost. There is
no single, accepted way to convert a QName into a URI or vice

<h4>XML ID semantics</h4>
<p>Consider the following fragment of XML: <code>&lt;section
&gt;</code>. Does the <code>section</code> element have what the
XML Recommendation refers to as the ID <code>foo</code> (i.e.,
&quot;foo&quot; must not appear in the surrounding XML document more than
once)? One cannot answer this question by examining the element and
its attributes alone. In XML, the quality of &quot;being an ID&quot; is
associated with the type of an attribute, not its name. Finding the
IDs in a document requires additional processing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Processing the document with a processor that recognizes DTD
attribute list declarations (in the external or internal subset)
might reveal a declaration that identifies the <code>name</code>
attribute as an ID. <strong>Note:</strong> This processing is not
necessarily part of validation. A non-validating, DTD-aware
processor can recognize IDs.</li>
<li>Processing the document with a W3C XML schema might reveal an
element declaration that identifies the <code>name</code> attribute
as an W3C XML Schema <code>ID</code>.</li>
<li>In practice, processing the document with another schema
language, such as RELAX NG [<a href="#RELAXNG">RELAXNG</a>], might
reveal the attributes declared to be of ID in the XML Schema sense.
Many modern specifications begin processing XML at the Infoset
[<a href="#INFOSET">INFOSET</a>] level and do not specify
normatively how an Infoset is constructed. For those
specifications, any process that establishes the ID type in the
Infoset (and Post Schema Validation Infoset (<abbr>PSVI</abbr>)
defined in [<a href="#XMLSCHEMA">XMLSCHEMA</a>]) may usefully
identify the attributes of type ID.</li>
<li>In practice, applications may have independent means (such as
those defined in the XPointer specification, [<a href="#XPTRFR">XPTRFR</a>] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/#shorthand">section
3.2</a>) of locating identifiers inside a document.</li>
</ol>
<p>To further complicate matters, DTDs establish the ID type in the
Infoset whereas W3C XML Schema produces a PSVI but does not modify
the original Infoset. This leaves open the possibility that a
processor might only look in the Infoset and consequently would
fail to recognize schema-assigned IDs.</p>

<h4>Media types for XML</h4>
<p>RFC 3023 defines the Internet media types &quot;application/xml&quot; and
&quot;text/xml&quot;, and describes a convention whereby XML-based data
formats use Internet media types with a &quot;+xml&quot; suffix, for example
&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;.</p>
<p>There are two problems associated with the “text” media types:
First, for data identified as &quot;text/*&quot;, Web intermediaries are
allowed to &quot;transcode&quot;, i.e., convert one character encoding to
another. Transcoding may make the self-description false or may
cause the document to be not well-formed.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="no-text-xml">XML
and &quot;text/*&quot;</a></span></p>
<p class="practice">In general, a representation provider SHOULD
NOT assign Internet media types beginning with &quot;text/&quot; to XML
representations.</p>
</div>
<p>Second, representations whose Internet media types begin with
&quot;text/&quot; are required, unless the <code>charset</code> parameter is
specified, to be considered to be encoded in US-ASCII. Since the
syntax of XML is designed to make documents self-describing, it is
good practice to omit the <code>charset</code> parameter, and since
XML is very often not encoded in US-ASCII, the use of &quot;text/&quot;
Internet media types effectively precludes this good practice.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="practicelab">Good practice: <a id="no-charset">XML

<div id="xml-fragids" class="section">
<h4>Fragment identifiers in XML</h4>
<p>The section on <a href="#media-type-fragid">media types and
fragment identifier semantics</a> discusses the interpretation of
fragment identifiers. Designers of an XML-based data format
specification should define the semantics of fragment identifiers
in that format. The XPointer Framework [<a href="#XPTRFR">XPTRFR</a>] provides an interoperable starting point.</p>
<p>When the media type assigned to representation data is
&quot;application/xml&quot;, there are no semantics defined for fragment
identifiers, and authors should not make use of fragment
identifiers in such data. The same is true if the assigned media
type has the suffix &quot;+xml&quot; (defined in &quot;XML Media Types&quot; [<a href="#RFC3023">RFC3023</a>]), and the data format specification does
not specify fragment identifier semantics. In short, just knowing
that content is XML does not provide information about fragment
identifier semantics.</p>
<p>Many people assume that the fragment identifier
<code>#abc</code>, when referring to XML data, identifies the
element in the document with the ID &quot;abc&quot;. However, there is no
normative support for this assumption. A revision of RFC 3023 is
expected to address this.</p>

<h2>General Architecture Principles</h2>
<p>A number of general architecture principles apply to all three
bases of Web architecture.</p>
<div id="orthogonal-specs" class="section">
<h3>Orthogonal Specifications</h3>
<p>Identification, interaction, and representation are orthogonal
concepts, meaning that technologies used for identification,
interaction, and representation may evolve independently. For
instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources are identified with URIs. URIs can be published
without building any representations of the resource or determining
whether any representations are available.</li>
<li>A generic URI syntax allows agents to function in many cases
without knowing specifics of URI schemes.</li>
<li>In many cases one may change the representation of a resource
without disrupting references to the resource (for example, by
using <a href="#def-coneg">content negotiation</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>When two specifications are orthogonal, one may change one
without requiring changes to the other, even if one has
dependencies on the other. For example, although the HTTP
specification depends on the URI specification, the two may evolve
independently. This orthogonality increases the flexibility and
robustness of the Web. For example, one may refer by URI to an
image without knowing anything about the format chosen to represent
the image. This has facilitated the introduction of image formats
such as PNG and SVG without disrupting existing references to image
resources.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="principlelab">Principle: <a id="pr-orthogonality">Orthogonality</a></span></p>
<p class="principle">Orthogonal abstractions benefit from
orthogonal specifications.</p>
</div>
<p>Experience demonstrates that problems arise where orthogonal
concepts occur in a single specification. Consider, for example,
the HTML specification which includes the orthogonal
x-www-form-urlencoded specification. Software developers (for
example, of [<a href="#CGI">CGI</a>] applications) might have an
easier time finding the specification if it were published
separately and then cited from the HTTP, URI, and HTML
specifications.</p>
<p>Problems also arise when specifications attempt to modify
orthogonal abstractions described elsewhere. An <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/global.html">historical
version</a> of the HTML specification added a
&quot;<code>Refresh</code>&quot; value to the <code>http-equiv</code>
attribute of the <code>meta</code> element. It was defined to be
equivalent to the HTTP header of the same name. The authors of the
HTTP specification ultimately decided not to provide this header
and that made the two specifications awkwardly at odds with each
other. The W3C HTML Working Group eventually removed the
&quot;<code>Refresh</code>&quot; value.</p>
<p>A specification should clearly indicate which features overlap
with those governed by another specification.</p>
</div>
<div id="language-extensibility" class="section">
<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<p>The information in the Web and the technologies used to
represent that information change over time. Extensibility is the
property of a technology that promotes evolution without
sacrificing interoperability. Some examples of successful
technologies designed to allow change while minimizing disruption
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fact that URI schemes are orthogonally specified;</li>
<li>the use of an open set of Internet media types in mail and HTTP
to specify document interpretation;</li>
<li>the separation of the generic XML grammar and the open set of
XML namespaces for element and attribute names;</li>
<li>extensibility models in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), XSLT 1.0,
and SOAP;</li>
<li>user agent plug-ins.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of an unsuccessful extension mechanism is HTTP
mandatory extensions [<a href="#HTTPEXT">HTTPEXT</a>]. The
community has sought mechanisms to extend HTTP, but apparently the
costs of the mandatory extension proposal (notably in complexity)
outweighed the benefits and thus hampered adoption.</p>
<p>Below we discuss the property of &quot;extensibility,&quot; exhibited by
URIs, some data formats, and some protocols (through the
incorporation of new messages).</p>
<p><dfn>Subset language</dfn>: one language is a subset (or
&quot;profile&quot;) of a second language if any document in the first
language is also a valid document in the second language and has
the same interpretation in the second language.</p>
<p><dfn>Extended language</dfn>: If one language is a subset of
another, the latter superset is called an extended language; the
difference between the languages is called the extension. Clearly,
extending a language is better for interoperability than creating
an incompatible language.</p>
<p>Ideally, many instances of a superset language can be safely and
usefully processed as though they were in the subset language.
Languages that can evolve this way, allowing applications to
provide new information when necessary while still interoperating
with applications that only understand a subset of the current
language, are said to be &quot;extensible.&quot; Language designers can
facilitate extensibility by defining the default behavior of
unknown extensions—for example, that they be ignored (in some
defined way) or should be considered errors.</p>
<p>For example, from early on in the Web, HTML agents followed the
convention of ignoring unknown tags. This choice left room for
innovation (i.e., non-standard elements) and encouraged the
deployment of HTML. However, interoperability problems arose as
well. In this type of environment, there is an inevitable tension
between interoperability in the short term and the desire for
extensibility. Experience shows that designs that strike the right
balance between allowing change and preserving interoperability are
more likely to thrive and are less likely to disrupt the Web
community. <a href="#orthogonal-specs">Orthogonal
specifications</a> help reduce the risk of disruption.</p>

<div id="error-handling" class="section">
<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>Errors occur in networked information systems. An error
condition can be well-characterized (e.g., well-formedness errors
in XML or 4xx client errors in HTTP) or arise unpredictably.
<dfn>Error correction</dfn> means that an agent repairs a condition
so that within the system, it is as though the error never
occurred. One example of error correction involves data
retransmission in response to a temporary network failure.
<dfn>Error recovery</dfn> means that an agent does not repair an
error condition but continues processing by addressing the fact
that the error has occurred.</p>
<p>Agents frequently <em>correct</em> errors without user
awareness, sparing users the details of complex network
communications. On the other hand, it is important that agents
<em>recover</em> from error in a way that is evident to users,
since the agents are acting on their behalf.</p>
<div class="boxedtext">
<p><span class="principlelab">Principle: <a id="no-silent-recovery">Error recovery</a></span></p>
<p class="principle">Agents that recover from error by making a
choice without the user's consent are not acting on the user's
behalf.</p>
</div>
<p>An agent is not required to interrupt the user (e.g., by popping
up a confirmation box) to obtain consent. The user may indicate
consent through pre-selected configuration options, modes, or
selectable user interface toggles, with appropriate reporting to
the user when the agent detects an error. Agent developers should
not ignore usability issues when designing error recovery
behavior.</p>
<p>To promote interoperability, specification designers should
identify predictable error conditions. Experience has led to the
following observations about error-handling approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protocol designers should provide enough information about an
error condition so that an agent can address the error condition.
For instance, an HTTP 404 status code (not found) is useful because
it allows user agents to present relevant information to users,
enabling them to contact the representation provider in case of
problems.</li>
<li>Experience with the cost of building a user agent to handle the
diverse forms of ill-formed HTML content convinced the designers of
the XML specification to require that agents fail upon encountering
ill-formed content. Because users are unlikely to tolerate such
failures, this design choice has pressured all parties into
respecting XML's constraints, to the benefit of all.</li>
<li>An agent that encounters unrecognized content may handle it in
a number of ways, including by considering it an error; see also
the section on <a href="#ext-version" class="addrefnb">extensibility and versioning</a>.</li>
<li>Error behavior that is appropriate for a person may not be
appropriate for software. People are capable of exercising
judgement in ways that software applications generally cannot. An
informal error response may suffice for a person but not for a
processor.</li>
</ul>

which concerns the source of authoritative metadata.</p>
</div>
<div id="protocol-interop" class="section">
<h3>Protocol-based Interoperability</h3>
<p>The Web follows Internet tradition in that its important
interfaces are defined in terms of protocols, by specifying the
syntax, semantics, and sequencing constraints of the messages
interchanged. Protocols designed to be resilient in the face of
widely varying environments have helped the Web scale and have
facilitated communication across multiple trust boundaries.
Traditional application programming interfaces (<abbr>APIs</abbr>)
do not always take these constraints into account, nor should they
be required to. One effect of protocol-based design is that the
technology shared among agents often lasts longer than the agents
themselves.</p>
<p>It is common for programmers working with the Web to write code
that generates and parses these messages directly. It is less
common, but not unusual, for end users to have direct exposure to
these messages. It is often desirable to provide users with access
to format and protocol details: allowing them to “view source,”
whereby they may gain expertise in the workings of the underlying
system.</p>
